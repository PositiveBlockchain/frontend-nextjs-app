## Deploy on Vercel

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.

### GitHub and Vercel Integration

This project is integrated with Vercel, a cloud platform for static and serverless deployments. The integration allows for seamless deployment of the Next.js project directly from GitHub. Here's an overview of how the integration works:

#### Staging Deployments

When you push changes to any branch, including feature branches, the Vercel integration automatically creates a staging deployment for that branch. This staging deployment allows you to preview and test your changes in an isolated environment.

To access the staging deployment for a specific branch, navigate to the Vercel dashboard or check the deployment status section on the GitHub repository page. You will find a link to the staging deployment associated with your branch.

#### Production Deployments

Pushing changes to the `main` branch triggers an automatic deployment to the production environment. This means that all changes merged into the main branch will be deployed and made available to end-users.

The production deployment is accessible using the project's primary URL. Once the changes are deployed, users can access the latest version of the application.

#### Deployment Workflow

The GitHub and Vercel integration follows a continuous deployment workflow, ensuring that new features, bug fixes, and improvements are seamlessly deployed to both staging and production environments. The typical workflow includes the following steps:

1. Create a new branch from the main branch to work on a specific feature or bug fix.
2. Make changes and commit them to your branch.
3. Push your branch to GitHub.
4. Vercel automatically creates a staging deployment for the branch.
5. Preview and test your changes in the staging environment.
6. Once satisfied, create a pull request to merge your branch into the main branch.
7. After the pull request is approved and merged, Vercel automatically deploys the changes to the production environment.

#### Monitoring Deployments

Vercel provides detailed information about deployments, including the status, duration, and any potential issues that occurred during the deployment process. You can access this information in the Vercel dashboard or by checking the deployment status section on the GitHub repository page.

Additionally, Vercel integrates with various notification channels to keep you informed about deployment statuses, such as email notifications or integration with messaging platforms like Slack.
