Levels above 450 ppm risk runaway feedback loops—including more warming—that will be difficult to stop.\n\nWe can do this.\nCO2 can be removed from the atmosphere by ecological and/or industrial means. It can be sequestered in trees, kelp, soil, minerals, and even manufactured products like plastics and timber.\n\nA new price on carbon.\nOur new currency is backed by carbon removal. Every token is worth 1 ton of CO2 removal and will finance a new economy of restoration.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\nWhat are the different types of carbon removal?\nThere are many ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They fall into three main categories: ecological, industrial, and hybrid. \n\nEcological carbon removal can be achieved through better management and restoration of ecosystems on land and in the ocean.\n\nReforestation is the establishment of forests or stands of trees where there previously was no recent forest cover. Carbon dioxide is captured by photosynthesis and is stored in the biomass of the forest. \nBlue Carbon refers to carbon captured by the world’s oceans and coastal ecosystems. The carbon is captured by marine life, and ends up being stored as biomass or in sediments. Algae, kelp, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses can all sequester carbon. Many animals help drive these processes, including sea otters, tiger sharks, turtles, and sperm whales.\nSoil Carbon Storage refers to techniques that can increase the organic and inorganic matter stored soils on farms and other managed lands. \nIndustrial carbon removal refers to engineered solutions that do not depend on ecological processes. \n\nDirect air capture with mineral geologic sequestration uses machines to extract and concentrate carbon dioxide to store in mineral carbonates with no economic value. \nDirect air capture into products uses machines to extract and concentrate carbon dioxide into products ranging from concrete, polymers, graphene, and other stable materials containing carbon molecules formerly in the air. \nHybrid carbon removal solutions combine ecological and industrial processes. \n\nBioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) relies on biomass to remove carbon dioxide, generate energy at a power plant, and produce gaseous emissions which can be captured and stored underground. \nBiochar also relies on biomass to remove carbon dioxide and generate energy, but has a process that starves the fuel of oxygen, thereby leaving behind a residue that when spread over soil creates a negative emission. \nBiosequestration in materials is any approach that leverages biology to create a carbon sink in products—ranging from carpets to clothes to building materials. \nEnhanced weathering covers a number of geologic processes that occur on land or in ocean where certain minerals react with carbon dioxide and turn it into a solid, sequestered form.\n \nWhat is Carbon Removal?\nCarbon removal refers to any ecological or industrial approach that can take carbon dioxide out of atmospheric or oceanic circulation beyond what would have occurred without humans. Right now, carbon removal approaches have different costs, degrees of maturity, measurement needs, permanence, energy consumption/production, and additional uncertainties. But they are all the same in their growing potential as ways to capture and store carbon dioxide in order to help reverse climate change.\n\nWhy do we need Carbon Removal to stop climate change?\nSince the industrial revolution, mankind has burned fossil fuels to produce energy which release greenhouse gases. In spite of long understanding the clear linkage between excess greenhouse gases (predominantly carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere and oceans and global climate change, humans have been unable to stop emitting. While reducing and replacing carbon emissions are key components to slowing down the flow of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years—warming the planet—the only way to stop the most severe effects of climate change is by balancing the total stock of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This can only be achieved through carbon removal.\n\nWhy blockchain for carbon removal?\nThe blockchain allows for a number of new opportunities to establish a market for carbon removal. Blockchain technologies allow us to issue a token, NORI, which sets one uniform price on removing carbon dioxide. Because a carbon removal credit can only be used once, and is immediately retired, our blockchain system avoids double counting, which occurs in the design of all other traditional carbon offset schemes. Furthermore, using a blockchain solution allows for complete transparency to the new type of carbon removal asset. Blockchain allows for substantially lower verification costs through automation and removing the many middle men involved in traditional carbon removal transactions. Lastly, through using a blockchain token as a medium of exchange, this solution removes the requirement for project sellers and buyers to find a counterparty, allowing all parties to participate in a fungible market.\n\nHow does the token relate to carbon removal?\n1 Nori token allows for the purchase of a carbon removal credit (CRC). Think of it like a gift card that allows you to pay for carbon removal. One Nori token pays for one CRC. The Nori token can be purchased at any time and when it is spent in the Nori platform will immediately transfer ownership of a carbon removal credit to the buyer.\n\nWho can use the Nori platform?\nWhile anyone can purchase a Carbon Removal credit with a Nori token, we’ve identified a few important categories to get started:\n\nIndividuals who are looking for direct ways combat climate change\nCryptocurrency enthusiasts\nClimate change activists\nBusinesses with a sustainability vision and carbon removal mandate\nHow do you generate carbon removal credits?\nWhenever a seller performs a carbon removal action, we first verify that the carbon dioxide has actually been removed from the atmosphere and stored. The seller either uploads data manually, or the removal data is automatically reported into the Nori platform. This generates the creation of a new Carbon Removal Credit smart contract that is now available for purchase by a buyer.\n\nHow is Nori different from other voluntary carbon offset registries?\nWe only accept carbon removal projects. Reductions in emissions are not good enough.\nNori abstracts the exchange of CRC for Nori tokens by selling CRCs to buyers in a First In First Out (FIFO) order as they’re entered into the marketplace. We are commoditizing CO2.\nNori reduces the overhead costs for CRC providers by as much as 50% through the use of automated sensors and Internet of Things devices to measure how much CO2 was removed.\nBy accounting for the ownership of the CRCs on the blockchain, Nori eliminates the double-counting problem that has plagued past attempts at creating healthy carbon offsets markets.\nNori is establishing the framework for carbon accounting methodologies that are transparent, iterative, and with an open-source software perspective.

It is based on individualised currencies and a social graph of trust between these currencies. When new users join Circles, their personal cryptocurrency is created on a smart contract-enabled blockchain. This currency is then regularly minted and added to their account, forming the basis of Circles' UBI properties. The money becomes valuable only if the account owner connects to other accounts, and agrees to trust their personal currencies, treating them as identical to any other Circles currencies that they hold. These trust relationships form circles, fostering local networks and mutual economic cooperation. Through the use of blockchain technology, we expect Circles to be both resilient and globally accessible, which may be the key catalyst to make a Universal Basic Income achievable within the near future.\n\nCredit-Based\nIn traditional debt-based currencies one sells goods, borrows money, or invests working power to receive money. With Circles, one receives money unconditionally to engage with their community, creating value through offering goods or services.\n\nDecentralized\nA worldwide basic income is something so powerful that no single entity should have control over the money or its recipients. Using blockchain technology, Circles will be independent of any central issuing authority or institution.\n\nResilient\nCircles will run on the blockchain, a secure, decentralised, and autonomously managed database. Since the system's money emerges from a network of peer-to-peer relationships, it is possible to maintain stability on a local level, regardless of how things go at the national or global scale.\n\nFostering Cooperation\nCircles promotes cooperation and economic interaction by creating local trade networks. The more connected community members are to each other, the more valuable their network becomes.\n\nHoarding Resistant\nCircles has an inbuilt inflation target of 5% per annum to discourage hoarding. This also increases the velocity of money in circulation, creating more opportunities for exchange and economic activity.\n\nSeigniorage\nSeigniorage refers to the profit made from the difference between the production costs and the value of money. As Circles is a credit-based currency that costs almost nothing to create, you will retain almost all of this value as first spender.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Basic Income on the

interest rates), benefiting both parties by obtaining higher yields and lower interest rates respectively.\nRegulatory barriers have so far hindered the development of transnational crowdlending platforms, so we believe a fully decentralized system (DAO) will facilitate global transactions between investors and borrowers.\nThanks to the low cost of system use and thanks to the community of

Partnering with governments, NGOs and social enterprises, it provides  users with information, inspiration, and access to improve their health and wellbeing. \n\nUsing Stellar’s open-source protocol, Praekelt is working on a mobile wallet that allows people to save cash or airtime using Vumi, their messaging platform—think Whatsapp, but open source and designed for the developing world, with a focus on improving the economic security of girls in South Africa.\n\nWhy girls?\n\nIn the developing world, only 37% of women have bank accounts. Research from Women’s World Banking has shown that poor women are inherent savers, putting away 10-15% of their earnings for emergencies. Due to a lack of financial services, however, they’re forced to save in unreliable and sometimes expensive ways—women often hide cash in their homes, where it isn’t secure, or buy livestock, which can become ill or die.\n\nWe believe that low-cost and reliable methods for savings could have an enormous impact on women, as well as on their families and communities.\n\nVumi already powers South Africa’s national maternal healthcare program, MomConnect, which sends expectant mothers prenatal health information over the course of their pregnancies. After a successful launch in South Africa last year, Praekelt is introducing the service in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country. Since its founding, Praekelt’s programs have reached over 50 million people across 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Promoting Economic Security for Girls in South Africa","primary_headquarter_city":"Johannesburg","primary_headquarter_country":"South Africa","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Africa","hq_subregion":"Southern Africa","year_creation":"2015","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/praekeltorg","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/praekeltorg","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://www.stellar.org/blog/investing-in-the-future-with-vumi/\nhttps://gigaom.com/2015/02/05/stellar-south-african-nonprofit-to-bring-digital-savings-to-young-girls/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Stellar","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"South Africa, Nigeria","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@praekelt.org"},{"slug":"tempos-stellar-integration","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.521","ref":"86","project_name":"Tempo's Stellar integration","active":"Active","website":"https://tempo.eu.com/en","categories":"Finance & Insurance","main_category":"Finance & Insurance","sub_categories":["Financial Inclusion","Peer-to-peer transactions"],"sub_categories_1":"Financial Inclusion","sub_categories_2":"Peer-to-peer transactions","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"1, 17","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,17,1,17,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a remittance system from Europe to the world using Stellar to achieve Competitive Prices and Higher Margins","long_description":"Tempo facilitates remittances from Europe to the world, a $150 billion market.

Asset is how the network refers to an item of value that is stored on the ledger.\nOne lumen is a unit of digital currency, like a bitcoin.\nWhile you can’t hold a lumen in your hand, they are essential to the Stellar network—they contribute to the ability to move money around the world and to conduct transactions between different currencies quickly and securely.\nIn 2014 the Stellar network launched with 100 billion stellars, the original name of the network’s native asset.\n\nIn 2015, with the launch of the upgraded network, the name of the native asset changed from stellar to lumen to distinguish it from 1) the Stellar network itself and 2) Stellar.org, the nonprofit organization that contributes to development of the network.\n\nAPPLICATIONS\nSeveral nonprofits and businesses are implementing Stellar as financial infrastructure, particularly in the developing world. One such example is Praekelt Foundation, which will be integrating Stellar into Vumi, its open-source messaging app, to let young girls in Sub-Saharan Africa save money in airtime credits.\n\nParkway, a licensed mobile money operator, uses the Stellar network to connect Nigeria’s five major telcos, enabling customers of different mobile money services to send money to one another.\n\nOradian, a cloud-based banking software company, also plans to use the Stellar network to connect microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Nigeria.\n\nIn December 2016 more partnerships were announced, including in the Philippines, India and West Africa.\n\nIn the month of October 2017 Stellar and IBM created a partnership to increase the speed of global payments.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Develop the world's new financial system","primary_headquarter_city":"San Francisco","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2014","founder_names":"Jed McCaleb, Joyce Kim","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/stellarorg","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/stellarfoundation","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/stellar-development-foundation/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/causeintegration/2017/10/25/initial-coin-offerings-can-issue-social-change-too/#bfe28f72541f","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"XLM","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Stellar","coinmarketcap_url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/stellar/","github_link":"https://github.com/stellar","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"press@stellar.org"},{"slug":"180-works","":"","original_source_name":"added / claimed website","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.437","ref":"885","project_name":"180.works","active":"inactive","website":"https://180.works/","categories":"Aid & Philanthropy","main_category":"Aid & Philanthropy","sub_categories":["Donation & Charities","Refugee crisis","Disaster Relief"],"sub_categories_1":"Donation & Charities","sub_categories_2":"Refugee crisis","sub_categories_3":"Disaster Relief","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"10","second_sdg":"10","third_sdg":"10","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",10,10,10,","number_of_sd_gs":"3","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a project using Stellar Blockchain to manage world-wide donations and project payments scalable to millions of people in need of work and assistance, resulting in completed transactions for a fraction of traditional transactions costs in just a matter of seconds","long_description":"180 plans to transform the $1 trillion charity sector through the development of an unparalleled peer-to-peer network, powered by Stellar Blockchain, accessed through an app for donations and distribution of funds.

Bob’s Repair is here to change that. The Prandecki brothers, together with blockchain experts and experienced software engineers, founded Bob's Repair with the mission of launching a decentralized platform that will bring trust and fair pricing back to the consumer. In order to fight review fraud, advertising fees and provide the consumer with transparency, the Bob's Repair Application will be built on the STEEM blockchain, which has a three second block time and no transaction costs.\n\nAbout Bob's Repair\nTo solve review fraud, hidden costs due to advertising fees, and inflated costs to lack of pricing transparency, Bob’s Repair will build the Bob Application on the STEEM blockchain. The Bob Application will consist of a sophisticated iOS, Android, and web application.\n\nThe Bob Application leverages blockchain technology to fight review fraud. The Bob Application will be built on the STEEM blockchain due to its three second transaction time and no transaction costs. The Bob Application will store all financial transactions that take place on Bob’s Repair on the blockchain. Then, when both sides of a transaction - consumer and contractor - leave a review, Bob’s Repair will link that review to the actual financial transaction. By linking reviews with actual financial transactions, consumers can trust that the review is real and unaltered. Real reviews, from real consumers, provides better information so consumers can make better decisions.\n\nThe Bob Application will not have advertising from contractors. As a result, contractors will not pass on advertising costs to consumers. Contractors cannot buy visibility on Bob’s Repair through advertising. Rather, due to the functions of upvoting, flagging posts, and user reputation on the STEEM blockchain, visibility is governed by merit. For instance, if a contractor has more verified positive reviews, then that contractor will have a more significant presence. This structure will eliminate hidden advertising costs.\n\nThe Bob Application will have transparent pricing. Each review will provide the cost of the service, broken into the material and labor costs. Consumers will be able to easily search reviews to determine the actual material and labor costs for a certain service. This transparency will drive down prices and fight inflated costs.\n\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"High Quality Contractors & Transparent Pricing","primary_headquarter_city":"Las

The solar installation owners registered to the SolarCoin network receive a SolarCoin for each MWh of solar electricity that they produce.\n\nThis Digital Asset will allow solar electricity producers to receive an additional reward for their contribution to the energy transition, which will develop itself through network effect.\n\nLUMO IS A SOLARCOIN PIONEER IN FRANCE AND EUROPE\nLumo joins SolarCoin in France and Europe so that by the end of 2016 Lumo users will receive directly on their Lumo account this new form of reward to thank them for the social impact of their investment.\n\nBy acting as pioneers with this new reward, Lumo users contribute to its growth and thus, towards the valuation of this Digital Asset, as it gains recognition from businesses in the “Impact Investing” community.\n\n“With SolarCoin, Lumo will be able to measure the double bottom line of its products: being profitable investments and helping tackle  climate change” explains Alex Raguet,  Lumo’s CEO.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"France","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"","organization_type":"partnership","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"SolarCoin","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Lumo,Electricchain,SolarCoin","servicing_area":"France","servicing_region":"Europe","subregions":"Western Europe","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"Francois Sonnet","individual_contact_2_at_project":"Francois.Sonnet@electricchain.org"},{"slug":"gainforest","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Ronald","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.413","ref":"685","project_name":"Gainforest","active":"Active","website":"http://gainforest.net","categories":"Climate & Environment","main_category":"Climate & Environment","sub_categories":["Climate & carbon reduction"],"sub_categories_1":"Climate & carbon reduction","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"13","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",13,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a transparent, scalable platform that allows anyone to become a stakeholder via blockchain-powered smart contracts.

Smart ID provides a new, transparent way for individuals, organisations and devices to obtain, verify and share identity credentials with one another.\n\nUsers can create and store identity attributes like an ID reference, driving licence or passport, which can be endorsed by third parties to form verifiable credentials for use within any digital interaction. The platform offers vast opportunities for the automation of identity linked processes such as customer registration or KYC (Know Your Customer).\n\nLooking ahead, a smart identity can hold digital assets representing money or physical property, enabling users to complete complex transactions involving the exchange of ownership and other forms of value transfer, all within a single platform.\n\nHow Smart ID works\nSmart ID makes it easier for customers to manage their identity information by reducing the number of places they need to maintain it, and simplifying the process of sharing it with others.\n\nFor organisations, Smart ID provides a platform for efficiently receiving and verifying customer information, and for staying up to date with changes on an ongoing basis.\n\nUsers register a Smart ID and load identity attributes into it, such as a driving licence, company registration identifier or device id (or anything else), which are private by default but can be optionally shared with others.\n\nTo build trust in this information, third parties can add revocable endorsements to each attribute to authenticate their validity.\n\nThis combination of features enables a user to obtain verifiable credentials which can be used to enable automation of identity verification processes within any digital process (such as new customer registration).\n\nOur first use case, the Smart ID KYC Application, enables Financial Institutions of all sizes to use Smart ID to manage the end to end know your customer process for small and medium sized enterprises in a simple, digital, and cost effective way.\n\nUsing the power of Blockchain\nDeloitte Blockchain is a specialist team within Deloitte. We advise, design and implement innovative solutions applying blockchain technology.\n\nWe span all industries and are tightly connected on a global level with blockchain specialist groups across Deloitte, including our broader FinTech initiative The Grid and the EMEA Financial Services Blockchain Lab which is coordinated out of Dublin.\n\nOur Blockchain team works closely with other centres of excellence in digital, analytics and information management to create ground breaking new thinking. We have over 100 Blockchain SMEs comprising of developers, designers and thought leaders, who work with international organisations looking to roll out blockchain-enabled solutions across the globe.\n\nOur team of experts work with you to develop blockchain capabilities. From identifying the best use case, assessing suitability, developing proof of concepts and building market ready solutions. We have a range of offerings to accelerate your use of blockchain which can be tailored to provide a launchpad for rapid solution development.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Smart ID, redefining the\nway we identify ourselves -\nthe future of digital identity","primary_headquarter_city":"London","primary_headquarter_country":"United Kingdom","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"Michael Robinson","organization_type":"corporate","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/deloitteuk","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/deloitteuk","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=zpO7eH5FYdo","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Private","blockchain_technology":"private blockchain (not known)","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"microbinson@deloitte.co.uk"},{"slug":"chromaway","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.462","ref":"37","project_name":"Chromaway","active":"Active","website":"https://chromaway.com/\n","categories":"Government & Democracy,Identity & Ownership","main_category":"Identity & Ownership","sub_categories":["Land & Titling","eGovernment & Public Services"],"sub_categories_1":"Land & Titling","sub_categories_2":"eGovernment & Public Services","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9","second_sdg":"9, 16","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,9,16,","number_of_sd_gs":"3","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a platform and blockchain technology company for smart contracts and issuing and transferring assets such as land registries, actively working with institutions governments to eliminate fraud and errors, and greatly reduce the administrative burden of land registration and title transfer","long_description":"ChromaWay started with the pioneering work done by Alex Mizrahi on original colored-coins since 2012, when he made the first implementation.

The LGBT Foundation will drive the adoption of the LGBT Token as a method of payment in everyday transactions for businesses both digital and physical. To jumpstart this, Hornet Networks, the sponsor of the LGBT Foundation, will adopt the Token among its 25m users—some 10% of the LGBT community worldwide—and accept the LGBT Token as a means of payment for its services.\n\nGoals of the LGBT Token\n\nLGBT Identity Management\n\nEnable LGBT members to verify and protect their identities, especially in countries where they face repercussions.\n\nPink Economy\n\nHarness the economic might of the worldwide LGBT community by implementing a viable payment system for goods and services.\n\nLGBT Impact\n\nSet aside a portion of Tokens every year to generate funding to tackle LGBT discrimination, oppression, and inequality on a global scale.\n\nTHE LGBT FOUNDATION\nThe Foundation is a not-for-profit organization with the mission to create the LGBT Token cryptocurrency and leverage blockchain technology to define and grow the global pink economy. The LGBT Impact branch of the Foundation will give back to the community by supporting causes and organizations that aim to advance the rights of the LGBT community around the world.\n\nProtect the Community\n\nHelp members of the global LGBT community protect their identities in all transactions with blockchain technology.\n\nUnderstand the Economy\n\nFully define and understand the scale and scope of the worldwide pink economy in order to help it grow.\n\nHarness its Potential\n\nUse the power of the pink economy to help champion LGBT causes around the world by giving back.\n\nUSECASES\nOne of the major challenges currently facing most cryptocurrencies is that they are not yet viable in a real world setting, or for utility use on a daily basis. The LGBT Foundation aims to overcome that hurdle by working with businesses and partners that have agreed to adopt the LGBT Token as part of their everyday transactional business models.\n\nEXAMPLE USE CASES\n\nHornet Wallet\nHornet pledges to build an initial wallet as a showcase for other launch partners, including simple private key storage and backup capabilities, as well as QR code and NFC support. The wallet will allow Hornet’s 25 million users to send and receive money to and from one another, as well as purchase services and goods via Hornet. The goal is to provide a simple and intuitive interface so users can use their wallet without having any prior expertise with cryptocurrencies.\n\nTicket Purchase\nHornet has trusted relationships with event venues in many major cities including Paris, Sao Paulo, Taipei, and Hong Kong and aims to enable ticket purchases through various vendors using LGBT Token.\n\nLGBT Impact\nThe LGBT Impact program will select individuals and nonprofit organizations that provide services to the LGBT community to receive support. The Foundation and its advisers will conduct careful audits before listing any proposed organization, but Token holders can submit projects to allow for a wide spectrum of supported initiatives.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"The power of Blockchain in pursuit of equal rights","primary_headquarter_city":"Hong Kong","primary_headquarter_country":"China","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Asia","hq_subregion":"Eastern Asia","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Christof Wittig, Founder and CEO of Hornet","organization_type":"foundation","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/lgbt_token","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2148846642002295","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlPu9ezzPzQ","white_paper_url":"https://lgbt-token.org/download/","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://lgbt-token.org/an-interview-with-hornet-co-founder-chairman-president-sean-howell/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"LGBT","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Other","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Hornet","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"Raul Ignacio Romanutti from OST who built the token.

Our processes identify demand for these new arrangements, and then source, validate and accelerate solutions.\n \n Mission:\n Today’s energy system, the cornerstone of prosperity for over a century, is operating at too high an environmental and economic cost, and is still failing to reach 1 billion people on the planet. Unlocking innovation today will allow us to most effectively tackle the energy ‘trilemma’ of low cost, low carbon and resilient energy for all. No global organisation exists today to support this innovation. Energy Unlocked aims to fill that gap.\n \n Why?:\n Energy certificates energy has been part of our energy mix for over a century, but digital, technical, social and financial innovation are changing how we buy, produce and consume electricity, and making it possible to achieve 100 per cent Energy certificates power. Traditional \"command and control\" hierarchy in current energy markets is already being disrupted by decentralised intermittent Energy certificates and 'prosumers' who now produce as well as consume electricity. This trend is unlocking new ‘flexibility’ in the demand-side of energy: we can now store energy, or automatically shift consumption patterns to match Energy certificates generation.\n \n Embracing energy innovation today will make our energy system more resilient tomorrow. The world is more complex and interconnected than ever before; what happens in one part of the world can impact far-away economies. Severe weather events and local power outages disrupting critical infrastructure can cause political or economic instability. \n \n Supporting energy innovation means we can tackle climate change. Bloomberg New Energy Finance finds that even with 60 per cent Energy certificates by 2030, we are reaching dangerous levels of climate change within the next decade. We need to accelerate the pace of adoption of Energy certificates by enabling innovation not only in energy supply technologies, but in energy demand and storage as well.\n \n How?:\n n 2016, we ran the global Energy Productivity Innovation Challenge (EPIC) and sourced 100 companies that are part of doubling energy productivity to 2030, identified the 10 business model types that are emerging and markets where they can operate. In 2017, we are engaging corporate early adopters and leaders that will grow demand for these solutions. \n \n PARTNERS\n \n The business plan for Energy Unlocked was developed with support from Zennström Philanthropies in 2015. International NGO The Climate Group is a founding partner, and new UK electricity supplier Tempus Energy was a seed funder.

A study released last year by KnowTheChain (KTC), a partnership founded by U.S.-based Humanity United, showed that most food and beverage companies fall short in their efforts to solve the problem.\n\nThe study said Coca-Cola, one of 10 global companies looked at by KTC, has committed to conduct 28 country-level studies on child labor, forced labor, and land rights for its sugar supply chains by 2020.\n\nThe U.S. beverage giant said it has been exploring multiple blockchain projects for more than a year.\n\nBrent Wilton, the company’s global head of workplace rights, said in an email to Reuters, “We are partnering with the pilot of this project to further increase transparency and efficiency of the verification process related to labor policies within our supply chain.”\n\nThe new venture is intended to create a secure registry for workers and their contracts using blockchain’s validation and digital notary capabilities, said Blockchain Trust Accelerator (BTA), a non-profit organization involved in the project.\n\nBTA is a global platform for harnessing blockchain to deliver social impact.\n\nThe State Department said it will provide expertise on labor protection.\n\n“The Department of State is excited to work on this innovative blockchain-based pilot,” Deputy Assistant Secretary Scott Busby said in an email to Reuters, noting that while blockchain cannot compel companies or those in authority to abide by the labor contracts, it can create a validated chain of evidence that will encourage compliance with those contracts.\n\nThe Bitfury Group, a U.S. tech company, will build the blockchain platform for this project, while Emercoin will provide blockchain services as well, Bitfury Chief Executive Valery Vavilov and Emercoin Chief Technology Officer Oleg Khovayko said on Friday.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"United

As a small business owner, you can share decisions, contracts, authorisations and payments with your customers, lenders and suppliers via mobile, removing uncertainty and complexity.  \nYour customers, lenders, suppliers, authorities and other businesses need to know you can be trusted so we take the administration and burden of proof away with our tailored ratings, which are based on what you’ve delivered, rather than biased reviews.\nBecause we run on blockchain rails, with a reputation system based on behaviour rather than bank records or government ID, we're ideally placed to bring financial inclusion to micro and small businesses who don't have access to banks, so alongside our platform for Nordic customers, we're launching financial ecosystem support for the millions of unbanked businesses in developing economies.\nTrust based on facts, not opinions; Blockchain without the bullsh*t.\n\nhiveonline community finance builds the bridge between informal financial communities and the financial system. We dramatically reduce the cost and risk of lending or other financial services to informal businesses and savings groups like CARE’s VSLA.\n\nOur reputation system treats everyone fairly: borrowers get a score based on their financial behaviour; lenders on their performance and treatment of customers. Groups can borrow as a community.\n\nPoor communications infrastructure, typical in rural Africa, isn’t a problem, because it’s designed for low data use and low connectivity. It runs on any phone with a browser, so users don’t need smartphones. There’s an offline mode for the most remote communities, so they can transact without any connectivity. Fully traceable transactions give confidence to lenders, aid programmes, and investors.\n\nhiveonline unlocks access to affordable credit, insurance and savings for communities in the informal economy.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Helping entrepreneurs get access to credit and new markets","primary_headquarter_city":"Copenhagen","primary_headquarter_country":"Denmark","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Northern Europe","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"Sofie Blakstad","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/wearehiveonline","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/hivenetworkonline","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/hive.online/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Not known","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"TechStars 2019, Care International","servicing_area":"Niger, Ghana, Rwanda","servicing_region":"Africa"},{"slug":"spectral","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.475","ref":"535","project_name":"Spectral","active":"Active","website":"https://spectral.energy/","categories":"Energy","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Energy Trade","Energy Certificates"],"sub_categories_1":"Energy","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"7, 13","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a new platform for setting up local energy markets based on blockchain technology","long_description":"WHAT DRIVES US Growing awareness around the impacts of climate change has propelled a rapid movement towards fully renewable, emissions-free energy supply. At this moment, most grid infrastructure can only support a limited amount (10-20%*) of renewable energy input while remaining stable, due to the fluctuating nature of renewable energy streams. Current market models are based on a largely supply-driven energy economy which lacks the flexibility needed to allow for higher penetration of renewables. New, intelligent ways of managing energy supply and demand, combined with innovative business models, are needed in order to effectively manage our transition towards a clean energy economy. Our long-term vision is to develop scalable solutions that will revolutionize the way we provide for all of our core resources, focusing on the key areas needed for leading a healthy and fruitful life: energy, water, sanitation, food, shelter, and resource recovery. As our global population expands, the demand for energy and natural resources increases with it, putting more pressure on our already stressed planetary boundaries. It is visible across the board – from marine life and aquifers, to oil supplies and rare earth metals – we are rapidly depleting these finite resources and polluting our environment at alarming rates. As global supply chains become increasingly volatile and centralized systems are further strained, the number of people without adequate resource provision will continue to grow. Solving all of the challenges we face around resource security is a highly ambitious and long-term mission. The most we can do is to contribute our full efforts to help overcome the obstacles we face on our journey towards a sustainable future We believe that one of the most urgent issues is to solve the challenges for providing for our energy needs in a sustainable way. Not only is access to energy essential for high quality of life, but virtually everything is reliant on an input of energy. Our entire global socio-economic eco-system has been built upon a foundation of fossil fuels – everything from growing food to resource extraction and water purification. Leveraging the full potential of the nearly unlimited source of energy from the sun is the first step towards dealing with the rest of the systemic challenges we’ve encountered. That is why Spectral has chosen to begin with tackling the obstacles we face in transitioning the global energy sector towards 100% sustainable energy supply. URN-KEY SMART-GRID SOLUTIONS From building-level to neighborhood-scale applications, Spectral designs, implements, and maintains advanced smart-grid solutions tailored to the specific context. Sophisticated monitoring, management, and optimization of the complete energy package ensures maximal lifespan, efficiency, and reliability. With a proven track-record in systems engineering and project development, Spectral creates highly positive business cases for renewable-based microgrids. From securing additional pre-financing, to designing custom energy storage solutions, our team will do whatever is needed to realize the goals of your project.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Engineering the Smart Energy Future","primary_headquarter_city":"Amsterdam","primary_headquarter_country":"Netherlands","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2015","founder_names":"Tom Westra, Co-Founder & CCO; Floortje van Boevene, Co-Founder and Magical Fairy, Philip Gladek, Co-Founder & CEO; Stephen Donnelly, CIO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/spectral_energy","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/pg/spectralenergy/about/?ref=page_internal","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://www.solarplaza.com/channels/future-grid/11751/report-comprehensive-guide-companies-involved-blockchain-energy/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Not known","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Partner: Frauenhofer,CWI,Eneco","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"Europe","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@spectral.energy."},{"slug":"social-alpha-foundation","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.413","ref":"167","project_name":"Social Alpha Foundation","active":"Active","website":"https://www.socialalphafoundation.org/","categories":"Aid & Philanthropy","main_category":"Aid & Philanthropy","sub_categories":["Donation & Charities"],"sub_categories_1":"Donation & Charities","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"10","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",10,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a not-for-profit grant-making platform that focuses on supporting Blockchain education and outreach to empower communities to utilize Blockchain technology for social good","long_description":"Applicants submit a proposal to use Blockchain for a project generating social benefits in pubic health, education or environment.\n\n Social Alpha grants.

CommonsHood allows users to create new kinds of tokens simply via the app or its web interface, while, currently, this possibility resides only in the hands of technologists. Thus, CommonsHood creates an “Internet of Value 2.0” revolution analogous to the “Web 2.0” revolution, that allowed everyone, not just programmers, to publish their own contents on the Internet.\n\nThe goal of CommonsHood is to democratize local financial instruments: it allows communities to create new types of tokens to support financial inclusion and to increase the sustainability of the local economy. In particular, it provides commons and associations with instruments to help finance themselves issuing tokens representing prepaid cards, crowdfunding, complementary currencies, and to share tools and infrastructures using tokens representing access rights. It provides small retailers with tokens representing loyalty tools. It provides institutions with purpose-driven tokens to reward volunteers. It allows the dematerialization of tickets and collectibles. All tokens can be distributed to the Wallet app of other users, directly or via websites, QR codes, or via proximity marketing using geolocalization.\n\nThe use of Blockchain allows us to construct an open, decentralized and disintermediated infrastructure to avoid the fees of and data control by platforms such as group-buying or crowdfunding websites. It allows citizens to use a single general-purpose app for multiple services, rather than many different ones, each for a different association and retailer, that will never reach a critical mass of users. And, above all, Blockchain allows new communities to replicate the CommonsHood infrastructure without the need for each to have their own trusted party.\n\nCommonsHood has been developed by the University of Turin in collaboration with grassroot initiatives such as the Collaboration Pacts signed by citizens with the Municipality of Turin within the context of the new legislation on commons. CommonsHood will be trialled in the next few months in Turin and Athens with urban commoners, solidarity movements, institutions and associations of retailers, and the Wallet app is offered for use to all further initiatives in the territory.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"The “Internet of Value 2.0” revolution for social innovation in

While digital info access has increased exponentially, our ability to process information has stayed the same.\n \n Today's Internet of pages connected by links optimizes for linear reading. But it is poor for processing large amounts of info and discerning accuracy.\n  \n Hence, today's Internet is overwhelming, confusing, and fraught with contentious and disingenuous info.\n \n Misinformation causes confusion and misleads people to believe things that are false or to disbelieve things that are true. Pew Research found that 71% of US adults sometimes or often see made-up political news online. Misleading information is sufficiently prevalent such that only 4% of U.S. adults have a lot of trust in info on social media.\n \n The overwhelming amount and uncertain veracity of info leads to apathy, inaction, and poor choices on the individual and collective basis that threaten our survival.\n \n The Solution\n Bridgit is making the web more like the human brain with respect to connectedness. Bridgit decentralizes linking so users can build “bridges” on any page that connect information on an idea by idea basis - pieces of text, image, video, and/or audio - and have a relationship (eg., supporting). \n \n Bridgit is a browser overlay. When a user comes to a page where a bridge has been built and focuses their attention near the bridge, an overlay will display the available bridges. Users can also make notes, start conversations, and initiate collaborations on any page. Activities can be private, public, or visible only to specific communities of interest. \n \n Bridgit provides an unprecedented opportunity for advocacy and community-based organizations and their local audiences to connect as networked communities of engaged citizens around common interests. Communities can work together to inform themselves about the local issues and resources that are most relevant to their lives.\n \n How We Are Innovative\n We decentralize the link and connect publicly available information on an idea-by-idea basis through “bridges.” As communities connect ideas across pages and topics, patterns will reveal themselves, and more truth and understanding will rise to the surface of human consciousness as collective cognitive breakthroughs, thereby revealing paths towards resolution of seemingly intractable problems like Climate Change.\n \n Bridgit is a browser overlay so it’s available on every page and enables the community to expose false news right where it is.

But no-one knows how to proceed after such a reboot. We may be on our way to fundamental changes in the structure of our economy.\n\nPeer-to-peer technologies, such as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs, including blockchains) are providing completely new opportunities to organise our society. However, technologies are just enablers. We must set a direction for these developments. We must proactively conduct large scale experiments with alternative economic structures. The future of our society must rely not solely on ideologies, but on solid experiments and data.\n\nOur Generalised Merits (GMeRitS) endeavour aims to tackle this huge predicament by taking baby steps towards wide scale experiments with alternative economic structures. In particular, our aim is to try and evaluate various anti-rival compensation and governance structures.\n\nOUR VISION\nOur vision is based on intimate interconnection of three themes: money and debt shaping our collective thinking, market failures especially in the data markets, and the invention of DLTs.\n\nMoney and debt, as we know them today, are arguably among the most important social innovationswithin the last 5000 years. According to some scholars, those innovations have even shaped the way we perceive ourselves as individuals and how we relate to each other. The innovation in these domains has not stopped: on the contrary, it is accelerating with a rapid pace.\nThere is early but growing evidence that the current forms of ownership and payment are insufficient to efficiently clear new kinds of markets our society is increasingly based on, especially those related with information and data. We are evidencing structural market failures, evidenced by the birth of the giant data monopolies and the accumulation of “knowledge silos.”\nIndustrial revolution continues, and DLTs are one of its latest manifestations. DLTsmay be considered as the most potential accounting innovation since the 15th century, when double entry bookkeeping became commonplace. However, DLTs are not economic solutions themselves. Although DLTs enable governance decentralisation, tamper proofness, censor-resistance and resilience, the technology is still free to be exploited almost to whatever ideological and political purpose one wants.\nWe surmise that these themes – including societal pressures and technological possibilities – will lead to a very fundamental change in the way we perceive the economy and even ourselves. Careful institutional experiments and design is needed to set a direction for these developments. GMeRitS is carrying out these experiments.\n\nOUR WORK\nCurrently, GMeRitS consists of three empirical cases – REC currency, Mesensei community empowerment framework, and Merits rewarding system – and a continuously updated design toolkit to be used by anyone willing to develop their own frameworks based on our principles. Together these components form the fundamental building blocks of our economic, technological, and conceptual experiments.\n\nUsing DLT based infrastructure and mobile apps, based on already ongoing community experiments of REC, Mesensei and Merits, and gradually expanding thereof, we are experimenting and systematically studying collaborative economic structures, contributing to financial inclusion.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Generalised Merits for Respect and Social Equality","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"Finland","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Northern Europe","year_creation":"2019","founder_names":"","organization_type":"academic, partnership","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://github.com/GMeRitS","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Not known"},{"slug":"little-phil","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.438","ref":"457","project_name":"Little Phil","active":"Active","website":"https://littlephil.org/","categories":"Aid & Philanthropy","main_category":"Aid & Philanthropy","sub_categories":["Donation & Charities"],"sub_categories_1":"Donation & Charities","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"10","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",10,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a platform that uses blockchain technology to radically transform charity.

Health is an important condition for this and at the same time something that we do not always strive to achieve. It helps to make healthy choices on a daily basis. That is a very important starting point for Healthcoin: we see health as a 'thing' to be influenced every day.\n\nTo encourage you to make healthy choices more often, such as making a fresh salad instead of buying a pizza, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, we introduce Healthcoin; a concrete reward for healthy behavior. The principle is simple. You make healthy choices, earn hard Euro's in the form of Healthcoins and then spend these Healthcoins on things that are good for you.\n\nBesides that everyone with healthy choices can earn coins, there are also organized challenges. These are extra challenges in which participants compete against each other and earn a prize. For example, the municipality can start the 'Which neighborhood should most Healthcoins earn in May?' Competition, with a new football pitch for young people from the neighborhood as prize. Challenges make healthy choices even more enjoyable and even more profitable. School against school, class against class, sports club against sports club, street against street, client against client; everything is possible, as long as your health benefits.\n\nDownload the Healthcoin app and start saving!\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Make a healthy lifestyle fun and valuable!","primary_headquarter_city":"Assen","primary_headquarter_country":"Netherlands","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2015","founder_names":"Mike van Holsteijn\n","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/healthcoininfo","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/healthcoin","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIt2b1AYXQs","white_paper_url":"http://healthcoin.nl/ebookblogs/","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Private","blockchain_technology":"Not known","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Netherlands","servicing_region":"Europe","subregions":"Western Europe","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@healthcoin.nl"},{"slug":"fishcoin","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Karsten","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"eachmile has to be put additionaly into the database (Karsten: 10.05.19)","comment":"0.508","ref":"711","project_name":"Fishcoin","active":"Active","website":"https://fishcoin.co","categories":"Climate & Environment,Agriculture & Food","main_category":"Agriculture & Food","sub_categories":["Food Transparency","Life below Water"],"sub_categories_1":"Food Transparency","sub_categories_2":"Biodiversity","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"2, 15","second_sdg":"14, 15","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",2,15,14,15,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"an ecosystem of software tools provided by several organisations to track and trace seafood along the very diverse and fragmented seafood supply chain","long_description":"Fishcoin is designed to incentivize the collection and input of data to help better manage resources.\nAs the volume of data increases, efficiencies will be gained in the production and delivery\nof physical seafood goods, and with time, each mile of seafood supply chains will be\ntransformed to become more sustainable, responsible and profitable.

We aim to create innovative, collaborative solutions, based on the blockchain's guarantees of a secure, robust and transparent platform. We will do this at the lowest cost whilst providing the greatest benefit to all market participants.Decarbonisation: As wind and solar generation comes to represent an increasing proportion of our power generation mix, our electricity supply-base is increasingly intermittent and inflexible. Since electrical supply and demand have to be matched on a continuous basis, we need more demand-side flexibility.Decentralisation:Unlike traditional centralised coal plants, renewable assets are often connected to the local grid. This presents an opportunity to increase grid efficiency and reduce transmission losses. It also introduces new challenges such as two-way power flows, a need for greater visibility and integration of decentralised assets and introduces the potential for new, locational pricing models.Digitsation: Rapid developments in smart grid technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), home energy management system (HEMS), Internet of Things (IoT) and other connected devices offer greater visibility and control than ever before. It also creates new requirements for co-ordination, interpretation and data security.Democratisation: Increasing desire for a more active role in the energy market has lead to the rise of \"prosumers\" who seek to generate their own electricity from personal or shared community assets, and/or purchase energy directly through peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. Production is becoming more ‘democratic’ with more parties participating in the energy value proposition. We design efficient, robust and innovation friendly systems to support the Industry’s transition to smart grid infrastructure and new market norms of decarbonisation, decentralisation, digitisation and democratisation.

Our goal is to keep the social web grounded in the freedom of expression, information and speech.\n\nReserve shares in Gab to join and support a growing global community of people committed to free speech unencumbered by regulatory interference from special interests or the old guard of Silicon Valley. In order to be true to its mission and maintain its exclusive place as the world's first and only ad-free social network, Gab must be owned, powered and funded by you - The People.\n\nOur mission is to provide everyone with a censorship-proof social networking protocol that champions free speech, individual liberty, and the free flow of information online.\n\nThe Exodus Protocol\nGab started as a single, centralized application built on top of the existing internet infrastructure. We soon learned that centralized gatekeepers could prevent anyone from building and distributing an application, stifling innovation and market opportunity. After realizing this empirically when Gab was rejected from Apple's App Store for \"objectionable content,\" removed from Google's Play Store for \"hate speech,\" and threatened by our domain registrar for the same reasons: we knew that it was time for a new solution. \n\nOur vision is to evolve beyond one application by empowering developers from around the world to build on top of an open peer-to-peer social media protocol. We are calling this the Exodus Protocol and will be building on top of existing open sourced peer-to-peer technology to create a new peer-to-peer social media protocol of our own. We recognize that existing blockchain technology has many limitations including latency, cost, scalability, and a rapidly evolving ecosystem. While we are excited by the future potential of many projects in the blockchain space, we believe that building on top of existing peer-to-peer protocols such as the Dat Project, IPFS, and existing cryptographic peer-to-peer protocols are the best immediate path forward to getting the Exodus Protocol off the ground. \n\nPeer-to-peer connections and exchanges of value are paramount to our vision for the Exodus Protocol. With this in mind, we've determined that an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is the crowdfunding approach that aligns most directly with Gab's market offering.  We believe that, like many of our users, investors in Gab will be supportive of a crowdfunding campaign that champions a decentralized and truly democratic approach to raising capital. The crypto community inherently understands the importance of defending a free and open exchange of ideas on the web. Our aim is to empower everyone, not simply VCs or the 1%, to participate in our ICO. Unlike many ICOs, Gab has an existing product, customers, brand, and track record of success. We are seeking partners who share our longterm vision for the future and want to help us build a protocol that defends the freedom we love for generations to come. \n\nThe primary objective of this ICO fundraising campaign is to establish an Open Developer Ecosystem for the Exodus Protocol.  We will follow these key steps to make this happen:\n\nIncentivizing developers to build on top of the Exodus Protocol\nRecruiting select developers who have been scorned by 'Big Social'\nProviding an open source protocol that any developer can contribute to or build on\n\nThe Exodus Protocol stands for bringing people together of all races, religions, and creeds who share in the common ideals of Western values around individual liberty and the free exchange of ideas. \n\nHere at Gab, we put people first, providing them with the tools they need to create and shape their own online experience. Gab was launched to appeal to consumers unhappy with censorship. Like other social media platforms, Gab allows users to upload and stream their own videos - but then distinguishes itself by not censoring content based on viewpoint. The Exodus Protocol will compete against pre-existing platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook others by appealing to digital consumers who oppose political and/or ideological censorship.\n\nFree, Legal Speech\nFrom its inception, Gab has been committed to appealing to people of all races, backgrounds and political persuasions who support the free flow of information.  As Co-Founder & CEO Andrew Torba said upon its launch, “Gab is not FOR any particular group of people, political leaning, race, beliefs, or anything.  Anybody is welcome to express themselves on Gab.”\n\nOf course Gab does not advocate hate speech.  In fact, Gab terms state that it “treats all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their background, origins and point of view.”\n\nBut while Gab prohibits rhetoric that advocates violence or illegal activity and allows users to block hateful speech, Gab does not forbid any speech based solely on viewpoint.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"A censorship-proof P2P social protocol","primary_headquarter_city":"Clarks Summit","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"Andrew Torba, Co-Founder & CEO","organization_type":"corporate","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/gab-ai-inc./about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLgBOcZhuJc","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Not known","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"legal@gab.ai"},{"slug":"veridium-labs","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.521","ref":"541","project_name":"Veridium Labs","active":"Active","website":"https://www.veridium.io/","categories":"Energy,Climate & Environment","main_category":"Climate & Environment","sub_categories":["Climate & Carbon reduction","Energy"],"sub_categories_1":"Climate & Carbon reduction","sub_categories_2":"Energy","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"13","second_sdg":"7, 13","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",13,7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"3","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"an environmental blockchain company that has created the world’s first net-positive environmental & social impact offset token","long_description":"Veridium is a financial technology firm aiming to create a new asset class called “EcoSmart Commodities.” “Veridium will provide a new vehicle for corporations to embed environmental replacements into the cost of their products,” co-founder Todd Lemons told GTM.\n\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Automating the World's Carbon Markets","primary_headquarter_city":"Hong Kong","primary_headquarter_country":"Hong Kong","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Asia","hq_subregion":"Southeast Asia","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"William Evans, CEO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/VeridiumLabs","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/veridiumlabs/","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/veridium-labs/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"https://www.veridium.io/static/whitepaper.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Not known","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"IBM","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"inquiries@veridium.io","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"","individual_contact_2_at_project":"","email_2":"","partner_tag":"x"},{"slug":"i-solve","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.455","ref":"632","project_name":"iSolve","active":"Inactive","website":"http://isolve.io/","categories":"Health,Logistics & Traceability","main_category":"Health","sub_categories":["Health"],"sub_categories_1":"Health","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"3","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",3,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"an Enterprise Blockchain solution that complements existing systems and processes, breaks down data silos, ensures data provenance, and creates an interoperable and high-performance environment focused on improving patient outcomes","long_description":"The challenges faced by the Pharma Industry in managing their global supply chain go far beyond counterfeit medications.

Co-ops presently rely on paper-based records, verbal promises, and complicated agreements; this frequently causes critical problems due to lack of transparency, restricted access to price data, lying, graft, and corruption.\n\nAgriLedger is a Mobile App that records and transacts incorruptible truth using blockchain technology. It is a complete framework of integrated services for delivering an even playing field to farmers and co-ops. This solid framework of trust allows everyone to know they are working, buying, selling, and sharing things according to a cryptographic “Book of Truth” that is utterly incorruptible.\n\nTHE IDEA\nAgUnity Streamlines Co-Operative Operations By Putting A Simple Distributed Cryptoledger Mobile App Into The Hand Of Every Small Farmer.\n\nBlockchain\nAll transactions are permanently recorded on an incorruptible Blockchain ledger.\n\nNetwork\nBuild the world's largest network of small farmers and cooperatives.\n\nFramework of Trust\nCreating the framework of trust with integrated services for farmers and co-ops.\n\nCheap Smartphones\nProviding SmartPhones enabling small farmers to sell harvests and buy supplies efficiently\n\nFOOD SECURITY\nUsing Simple Technology, We Can Make Small Improvements That Will Have A Life Changing Impact For Billions Of People!\n\nOne-third of the world’s available food either spoils or gets thrown away before it ever reaches a plate—that’s enough to feed everyone in the world for two months. And with 1.2 billion people food insecure or undernourished, millions of vulnerable smallholder farmers losing profits they can’t spare, and a population expected to increase by 2 billion by 2050, we cannot afford to allow these losses to continue. – Rockefeller Foundation\n\nOn 470 million smallholder farms across Africa, lack of access to training and technology negatively impacts harvests and farmers livelihoods.\n\nWhen crops and food exports don’t make it to market, the economic development and global competitiveness of agriculture-dependent nations suffer as well.\n\n50% food produced in Africa is wasted.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nation (FAO), the amount of food wasted on the continent is enough to feed 300 million people. The statistics of food production compared to hunger suggest that Africa actually produces more than enough to feed itself.\n\nTHE CO-OPERATIVE\nFarmers Join Together In Co-Ops To Overcome The Challenges But Are Still Facing The Lack Of Following\n\n1 Trust\nLack of trust between co-op staff and farmers.\n\n2 Efficiency\nPaper-based systems are labor intensive, error prone and difficult for locals to understand.\n\n3 Audit\nNo audit trail enables corruption and graft.\n\n4 Transparency\nBoth farmers and Co-ops lack access to transaction records, market and price information.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Connecting the last mile","primary_headquarter_city":"Melbourne","primary_headquarter_country":"Australia","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Oceania","hq_subregion":"Oceania","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/agriunity","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpNioKiqsD0&feature=youtu.be","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"http://agunity.com/blog/blog-01.html","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Not known","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Africa","servicing_region":"Africa","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@agunity.com","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"David Davies","individual_contact_2_at_project":"David@agunity.com"},{"slug":"ribbon-blockchain","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.38","ref":"809","project_name":"Ribbon blockchain","active":"Active","website":"https://www.ribbonblockchain.com/","categories":"Health","main_category":"Health","sub_categories":["Patient data"],"sub_categories_1":"Patient data","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"3","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",3,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a decentralized and autonomous Public Health ecosystem platform for incentivizing Adherence, Behavior Change, quality point of care delivery and enforcing sovereign personal health data ownership and first rights of beneficiation to patients in the Data Economy","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Automating Public Health","primary_headquarter_city":"Johannesburg","primary_headquarter_country":"South Africa","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Africa","hq_subregion":"Southern Africa","year_creation":"2018","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ribbonblockchain/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not Known","blockchain_technology":"Not Known"},{"slug":"neco","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Maciej","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"They are building carbon neutral platfrom - stackchain (as oppose to  blockhain).

Connecting patients directly to medical research and incentivizing them to share their data with tokens, blockchain is the decentralized technology everyone was waiting for to move away from the current linear process of drug approvals, to a new iterative model where trustworthy digital health data is shared in real time between patients, life sciences and regulators. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) gave the FDA a mandate to accelerate approvals if more patient real world data was shared proactively by pharma. Embleema's blockchain speeds up this process with patient buy-in, accelerating time to market new drugs.\n \n We believe Blockchain technology is the ideal standard that can provide patients, healthcare professionals, health insurance payers and providers a shared, comprehensive, longitudinal, and trusted view of a patient's medical history. When preserved as a ledger of transactions, a patient's medical history is clearly accessible to all stakeholders with due authorization from the patient, and the best treatment option can be determined.\n \n PatientTruth™ is a Cloud and Blockchain-based software solution that connects to a patient's different medical records at the various centers of healthcare services, such as hospitals, primary care practices, rehabilitative centers, nursing homes and urgent care centers, and chains them into a consistent, comprehensive, and tamper-proof medical history. PatientTruth™ provides a holistic view of a patient's medical history across providers and care centers.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Own your health data","primary_headquarter_city":"New York","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Robert Chu\n CEO and CTO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/Embleema","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/pg/embleema","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://youtu.be/HL4Rz9YoPAA","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"RWE","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Not known","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Servier","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"yes know from Paris Agora PB startup pitch","project_official_email":"vgaland@embleema.com"},{"slug":"evolution-energie","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.433","ref":"582","project_name":"Evolution Energie","active":"Active","website":"http://www.evolutionenergie.com/news","categories":"Energy","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Energy Trade","Energy Certificates"],"sub_categories_1":"Energy","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"7, 13","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"an energy software for businesses and utility intensive organizations, which developped a blockchain electricity trading system","long_description":"The system, which was developed by the energy tech startup Evolution Energie, enables users to track renewable power as it moves through the electrical grid and mixes with energy from other sources. “Using blockchain, you can sell energy from your renewable sources to your neighbor without the help of a utility managing the process,” says Fabien Imbault, Evolution Energie’s managing director. “You could share your energy with neighbors or even sell it to a parked electric car on your street and get paid securely.”\n\nEvolution Energie started by building an interface that was simple enough for students at the school to purchase “green” energy from renewable energy sources. They’ve since rolled the system out to the town’s municipal buildings. Up next: businesses and homes.\n\nThe firm was one of the five winners of GE’s Digital Industry Europe competition, where GE selected startups to work with on Predix-based products. Evolution Energy plans to offer its blockchain electricity trading system to energy-sharing communities around the world by the end of the year. Imbault says that without collaborating with GE, the French startup would have struggled with the global nature of the challenge.

We support prepaid SIM cards from over 600 operators in 150 countries. Using Bitcoin allows us to cut costs, and pass the savings on to you. Full privacy and the top up happens as soon as the transaction clears.\n\nHow do I use this service?\nType in your number, pick a package, and then you pay. We have a step-by-step tutorial available here, and also a number of video instructions made by our users, available here.\n\nDash & Bitrefill partnership\nThe partnership will allow Dash customers to pay for their mobile recharge phone, monthly bills, and vouchers for prepaid mobile services, as well as the gaming platform Steam, through Bitrefill’s platform. Bitrefill, which currently supports Bitcoin and Litecoin as forms of payment, indicated strong demand from customers to integrate Dash due to its low fees, and near instant transaction speeds.\n\n“Dash’s ability to transact at near Visa like speeds with our InstantSend feature, as well as enable double-spend protected transactions, make it ideal for commerce partners like Bitrefill,” stated Dash Director of Global Business Bradley Zastrow. “We offer a solution that eliminates fraud while also providing an extremely fast form of payment, critical to the user experience. As a bonus, Dash will soon be offering a 10% discount when buying either phone or Steam vouchers using Dash through Bitrefill’s platform.”\n\nBoth Dash and Bitrefill share a similar mission to help service the underbanked and unbanked across the globe. As a result, both companies currently boast significant, overlapping customer bases in several countries- such as Venezuela, Chile, and Zimbabwe- that are plagued by the effects of hyperinflation and insufficient financial services such as digital payments providers. The new partnership will help both companies continue their expansion in these critical markets, offering cheaper, more efficient alternative payment methods to users.\n\n“We service underbanked communities around the world, and Dash’s InstantSend transactions and low fees will further help these communities,” explained Bitrefill CEO Sergej Kotliar. “We look forward to working with the Dash community to make paying for prepaid mobile phones more affordable and efficient.”\n\nCrowdfund Insider asked both platforms about Goldman Sachs Global Head of Investment Research Steven Strongin’s biting appraisal of the token and digital currency emerging market:\n\n“I agree with the Goldman Sachs’ report in that many of today’s cryptocurrencies will cease to exist at some point in the future,” responded Dash Director of Global Business, Bradley Zastrow via email. “There are too many coins that have a hyper specific purpose, some without even solid projects or roadmaps. To that extent, we probably are in a bubble at the industry level, but like the Goldman Sachs’ report pointed out, there will be clear winners. In my view, it’s the coins who a) solve a specific problem, b) have a strong governance structure and c) have a sustainable funding model which allows for proactive growth, like Dash, who will be the survivors.”\n\nSergej Kotliar, Bitrefill CEO, concurred, also via email,\n\n“I agree with the sentiment. There is currently a lot of hype in the field, overblown expectations and inflated valuations. That said, I am incredibly bullish on cryptocurrencies as a long-term invention, and upcoming technologies such as payment channels (Lightning networks), that will let cryptocurrencies fulfill the original promise of being ‘instant and cheap,’ while also maintaining a high level of decentralization.”\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"Stockolm","primary_headquarter_country":"Sweden","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Northern Europe","year_creation":"2014","founder_names":"Sergej Kotliar, CEO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/bitrefill","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/bitrefill","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Not known","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"support@bitrefill.com"},{"slug":"carbon-x","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Omar","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.463","ref":"269","project_name":"CarbonX","active":"Active","website":"https://www.carbonx.ca","categories":"Climate & Environment","main_category":"Climate & Environment","sub_categories":["Climate & Carbon reduction"],"sub_categories_1":"Climate & Carbon reduction","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"13","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",13,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a start-up enabling companies to satisfy the growing consumer demand for sustainable business practices.

GrainChain’s vision is to create a software ecosystem that empowers farmers in the global grain industry who wouldn’t normally have the budget to invest in certain technologies.\n\nGrainChain wants to level the playing field and reduce the number of intermediaries needed to complete a transaction. GrainChain does this by providing a transaction platform for the sale and purchase of grain and other commodities.\n\nOverall, GrainChain helps farmers engage with more buyers and increases trust and transparency throughout the value chain so that all actors can access information on the quality of the seed. In many instances it helps farmers increase profitability. For GrainChain, this starts in the fields of South Texas, where more than 1,000 farmers use its platform to generate smart contracts for the sale and purchase of grain. The farmers are paid instantly, and buyers receive immediate title to the commodity.\n\nGrainChain runs its platform with the help of blockchain technology. It works with two systems: a logistics system called HarvX and a grain governance system called SiloSys that tracks and maintains movement of a seed from the producer to the farm, including data on the origin of the seed, authentication of the seed, and seed storage.\n\nGrainChain’s blockchain solution is designed to collaborate with existing software systems that use its API. Therefore, GrainChain’s platform records all of this collected data in an immutable record that is perpetually linked to the commodity and the participants.\n\nWhen a farmer has a certain quantity of grain to sell, the farmer creates a smart contract sales agreement with all the sales terms defined — including logistics, storage, pest control, quality of the grain, and location — on GrainChain’s platform. The buyer can then evaluate the information on the smart contract and add variables to it. By accepting this smart contract, the buyer is effectively accepting the terms that the farmer included.\n\nGrainChain’s platform then calculates the net value for the contract and digitally escrows the buyer’s funds. Once the grain is delivered to the agreed-upon settlement location, it is verified by the system, and the buyer’s funds are automatically put into the farmer’s GrainChain wallet and converted to the local currency, which cuts out international banking and transfer fees.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"MacAllen","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2013","founder_names":"","organization_type":"corporate","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/grainchainio/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not Known","blockchain_technology":"Not Known"},{"slug":"inuk","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.429","ref":"347","project_name":"Inuk","active":"Active","website":"https://www.inuk.co","categories":"Climate & Environment","main_category":"Climate & Environment","sub_categories":["Waste & recycling","Climate & Carbon reduction"],"sub_categories_1":"Waste & recycling","sub_categories_2":"Climate & Carbon reduction","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"12","second_sdg":"13","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",12,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a tool to compensate carbon emissions","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"Bours Saint Maurice","primary_headquarter_country":"France","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/Inukapp","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/inukapp/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Not known","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"nuk@inuk.co","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"","individual_contact_2_at_project":"","email_2":"","partner_tag":"x"},{"slug":"involve-mint","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Katrie","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.402","ref":"801","project_name":"Involve Mint","active":"Active","website":"https://www.involvemint.io/","categories":"Government & Democracy,Products & Consumption","main_category":"Products & Consumption","sub_categories":["Community Mobilization","Sharing Economy"],"sub_categories_1":"Community Mobilization","sub_categories_2":"Sharing Economy","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"11, 16","second_sdg":"45,268","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",11,16,8,12,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"","long_description":"involveMINT strengthens communities through volunteerism and small business patronage.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"Pittsburgh","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2015","founder_names":"","organization_type":"non profit","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/involvemint/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not Known","blockchain_technology":"Not Known"},{"slug":"pharma-trace","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.4","ref":"793","project_name":"PharmaTrace","active":"Active","website":"https://www.pharmatrace.io","categories":"Health","main_category":"Health","sub_categories":["Patient Data","Drug Traceability"],"sub_categories_1":"Patient Data","sub_categories_2":"Drug Traceability","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"3","second_sdg":"3","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",3,3,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a healthcare ecosystem built on blockchain.

We have created the ixo protocol, technology that harnesses blockchain and next generation web standards, to collect and validate high quality data and create “proof of impact.” Proof is generated when an impact claim is made by a service provider and is verified by an evaluator or an oracle, validating the impact has been achieved. As a result, fraud and corruption are reduced, and both the service provider and the funder gain access to invaluable data about their impact. Increased confidence in the sector incentivizes funding and investment in sustainable development and adds to an accumulation of global impact data, which enables better visibility, planning, and decision-making for the future.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Protocols for Sustainable Development","primary_headquarter_city":"Zug","primary_headquarter_country":"Switzerland","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Central Europe","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Shaun Conway, Founder and President of Foundation Council","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/ixo_foundation","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/ixofoundation/","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/ixoworld/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/243097715","white_paper_url":"http://ixo.foundation/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/The-ixo-Protocol-Draft-White-Paper-3.0-for-technical-review-12_8_2017.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"Project for coffee aplication in Uganda https://medium.com/ixo-blog/voices-from-the-field-the-age-of-blockchain-will-it-bring-transparency-inclusion-and-resilience-daabbc6f7fb7\nhttps://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ixo-foundation-blockchain-based-response-un-call-data-revolution/\nhttps://techfinancials.co.za/2017/10/31/ixo-foundation-teams-up-with-ethereum-startup-consensys/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"ixo Protocol","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"https://github.com/ixofoundation","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Uganda, South Africa","servicing_region":"Africa","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"lucas and Karsten know tim;

Anyone will be able to purchase tokens from one company and use them anywhere on the Lytictail network.\n\nEven if the businesses are competitors, customers will be able to instantly exchange their tokens for the business of their choice’s tokens. This is done through the Lytictail exchange. Anyone will be able to go onto the exchange via website, mobile app, or in -store kiosk and trade their tokens for the desired company of their choice.\n\nLytictail is a centralized platform that consists of decentralized networks. Every entity that issues a token on our platform will be able to take advantage of our exchange. This allows for a digital interstate of commerce to be constructed for physical, real world applications.\n\nNetworks are comprised of the businesses that issue the tokens, as well as physical third parties. Third party escrow and auditing companies are used to ensure a fair and balanced system without having to relying on another technology. By utilizing the human element, we can introduce an honest centralized platform that can be completely trustless yet trustworthy.\n\nCompanies first inquire to acquire their own custom -made token. This includes logo, hosting, specifications on code, and software integration. After the inquiry, Lytictail implements our new proof-of-merit algorithm to determine the viability, longevity, and overall value of the company’s newly created token.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"#N/A","hq_subregion":"#N/A","year_creation":"","founder_names":"","organization_type":"non-profit","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/LyticTail\n","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/lytictail/posts","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgS1r3JN0jU","white_paper_url":"http://lytictail.io/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Lyticpaper.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"icobench","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"LYT","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"IOTA"},{"slug":"d-finity","":"","original_source_name":"JAFS","original_source_organization":"Blockchain

The Internet is missing a layer for secure identity which is currently costing us hundreds of billions of dollars each year. The Sovrin Foundation is showing the world that when we control our own identities, many exciting and liberating possibilities are at our fingertips.\n \nProviding an enduring solution for global identity requires significant effort and careful planning. The Sovrin Foundation exists to provide the human governance and trust frameworks that will be needed to establish ground rules and ensure the integrity of the network. To be effective at this task, the Sovrin Foundation has been designed to establish trust through transparency, diffusion, and neutrality.\n \nThe Sovrin Foundation has intentionally invited board members to represent expertise from across multiple industries and geographies, ensuring that special interests – whether commercial, governmental, or otherwise – do not unduly influence decisions. Our intent is to devise a process so that the elected Board of Trustees will be representative of the people and organizations who own identities on the Sovrin network. Furthermore, the Technical Governance Board will oversee the evolution of the open source code run by each node.\n \nSovrin Foundation is a non-profit. We don’t actually own the network – no one does, much like the Internet itself. The Sovrin network is public: everyone can get a Sovrin identity. Individuals and organizations own and control their identities. The Sovrin network is permissioned: the infrastructure for ensuring consensus on identity transactions is provided by carefully vetted and permissioned stewards who independently own and operate their nodes on the network. These combine to form a system of checks and balances that earns trust through action rather than promises.\n\nIdentity for all - Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an identity that is 100% owned and controlled by an individual or organization. No one else can read it, use it, turn it off, or take it away without its owner’s explicit consent. This simple form of identity is private, extremely secure, and goes where you go. This will enable trusted interactions to occur between individuals, institutions, and businesses.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Control Your Digital Identity - Personally manage your digital IDs online with the Sovrin Network","primary_headquarter_city":"Provo","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"Phil Windley, Chairman and President; Rondle Amstutz, Vice Chairman","organization_type":"foundation","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/SovrinID","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/SovrinID/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVHJiUrHv2A","white_paper_url":"https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Sovrin-Protocol-and-Token-White-Paper.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Hyperledger","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Aalto University,Absa,Amihan,Anonym Labs,ArtiFacts,ATB Financial,Attinad,Baker Hostetler,BIG,Blockscale Solutions,Certisign,Chain Partners,Cisco,Crypto Valley,Cynja Tech,Danube Tech,Dativa,Datum,Desert Financial,Telekom,Digicert,Digital Bazaar,Ebpi,Esatus AG,Evernym,Finicity,First Education,Consent,IBM,Infocert,iRespond,KYC Chain,Lab10,MakoLab,NEC,OAS Staff,Perkins coie,Qiy foundation,Regio IT,Royal Credit Union,Sicpa,SIta,Spark,Swisscom,Sygnet,The Kuwa Foundation,TNO,Truu,TwinPeek,Tykn,Unveil Social,Validated ID,Veridium","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"Helen Garneau","individual_contact_2_at_project":"helen@sovrin.org","email_2":"Nathan George"},{"slug":"intelligent-water-services","":"","original_source_name":"added / claimed website","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.355","ref":"916","project_name":"Intelligent Water Services","active":"inactive","website":"https://intelligentwaterservices.com/","categories":"Climate & Environment","main_category":"Climate & Environment","sub_categories":["Sanitation & Water"],"sub_categories_1":"Sanitation & Water","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"6","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",6,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Helping water and wastewater treatment utilities maintain the flow","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"#N/A","hq_subregion":"#N/A","year_creation":"2020","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Hyperledger","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global"},{"slug":"circulor","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Karsten","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"last quality check Karsten: 04.02.19","comment":"0.462","ref":"713","project_name":"Circulor","active":"Active","website":"https://www.circulor.com","categories":"Logistics & Traceability,Products & Consumption","main_category":"Products & Consumption","sub_categories":["Supply Chain Transparency","Minerals & raw materials"],"sub_categories_1":"Supply Chain Transparency","sub_categories_2":"Minerals & raw materials","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"45,268","second_sdg":"45,268","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",8,12,8,12,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a platform to track materials from mine to finished product, enabling manufacturers to prove ethical and sustainable sourcing","long_description":"Circulor is transforming the supply chains of raw materials using blockchain technology.

It’s simple, if the food vendors can sell more, we can distribute more, growing both of our businesses.”\n\nBrooke didn’t have far to look and formed a collaboration with IBM scientists in Nairobi to build and test a blockchain-enabled finance lending platform. But there was a catch. How could loans be provided when most of the vendors lack a credit score?\n\nLuckily, IBM scientists know a thing or two about using machine learning and mobile data and how to apply both towards developing credit scores – they’ve done it before. In a previous project with an African bank and mobile operator more than $3 million in loans were distributed.\n\nTwiga\nAll of the loans were managed by blockchain and executed via mobile phone SMS.\n\n“We analyzed purchase records from a mobile device and then apply machine learning algorithms to predict credit worthiness, in turn giving lenders the confidence they need to provide microloans to small businesses. Once the credit score is determined, we used a blockchain, based on the Hyperledger Fabric, to manage the entire lending process from application to receiving offers to accepting the terms to repayment,” said Isaac Markus, a researcher on the inclusive financial services group at IBM Research in Kenya.\n\nWith blockchain, the lending process becomes transparent to all permissioned parties involved, from the lending bank to the borrower’s bank and the loan applicant themselves. Blockchains are immutable, helping to reduce fraud, since no one single party can append the blockchain without consensus from the enti\n\nre network. Finally, blockchains employ a series of “smart contracts” which can be executed in real time, having the potential to significantly reduce the time it takes to manually process and issue a loan.\n\nTo test the new platform Twiga Foods and IBM ran a pilot at the end of last year with 220 small food kiosks, known locally as “mama mbogas” in Swahili, across Kenya.\n\nTwiga\nFrom left to right: Abdigani Diriye, manager, microfinance team, IBM Research – Africa; Grant Brooke, CEO and co-founder, Twiga Foods; Kevin Gakuru, small business owner and Andrew Kinai, software engineer, IBM Research – Africa\n\nThe eight-week pilot processed more than 220 loans with the average loan around $30 (3,020 KES), which increased the order size by 30 percent and profits for each retailer, on average, by six percent. The loans were for four and eight days with an interest rate of one and two percent, respectively.\n\nAll of the loans were executed via mobile phone and went directly toward working capital for the businesses. When a retailer had an order delivered, they would get an SMS with loan options for financing that order. They would then respond to the SMS confirming the loan option they preferred.\n\n“We had several iterations of the platform based on feedback from the retailers. The SMS-based solution provided an effective channel for a diverse set of users, some with limited IT literacy, to access financing for their orders,” said Andrew Kinai, the lead software engineer on the project at IBM Research.\n\nBased on the success of the pilot, the plan is for the platform to be rolled out to more SMEs across Africa by the end of the year and expanded into new sectors.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Blockchain-Based MicroFinancing for Food Kiosk Owners in Kenya","primary_headquarter_city":"Nairobi","primary_headquarter_country":"Kenya","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Africa","hq_subregion":"Eastern Africa","year_creation":"2013","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/twiga-foods/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_bvoV796dE","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Private","blockchain_technology":"Hyperledger","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"IBM","servicing_area":"Kenya","servicing_region":"Africa","subregions":"Eastern Africa"},{"slug":"aid-tech","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"Quality check > Carolina 14.05.19","comment":"0.492","ref":"63","project_name":"Aid:Tech","active":"Active","website":"https://aid.technology","categories":"Identity & Ownership","main_category":"Identity & Ownership","sub_categories":["Digital Identity"],"sub_categories_1":"Digital Identity","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9, 16","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,16,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"an award-winning company that focuses on the delivery of digital entitlements, including welfare, aid, remittance and donations using Blockchain & Digital Identity.\n","long_description":"Today, astronomical values are circulating throughout the public, private and third sector ecosystems. Yet, trillions of dollars are persistently unaccounted for. As a result, public trust in how funds are being spent is falling. The status quo becomes increasingly under threat; funding levels are unsustainable for the long-term future and stakeholders struggle to justify continuous support. It is those who are on the receiving end of these services that suffer the greatest impact. Inconsistent services and growing threats around what resources are available to them risk leaving the most vulnerable further disadvantaged.\n\nWe believe data, leveraged in a way that empowers both organisations and end-users, is the key to addressing these major challenges. Access to transparent and trusted data offers organisations the capability of transforming how services are delivered. Decision making becomes data-led. For end-users, they gain control over secured, personal data; the basis for greater agency in everyday transactions.\n\nUtilising innovative technologies, including blockchain, artificial intelligence and machine learning, AID:Tech has developed and deployed proven solutions for governments, corporates and NGOs. Blockchain becomes the key to securely and transparently capturing data. And, AID:Tech’s proprietary technology enables advances in the management and dissemination of data.

This empowers recycling ecosystems around the world and stops the flow of plastic into our oceans. All while helping people living in poverty build better futures. The Plastic Bank creates social and environmental impact in areas with high levels of poverty and plastic pollution by turning plastic waste into a currency.\n\nTo do this, The Plastic Bank provides a consistent, above-market rate for plastic waste, thus incentivizing its collection. Individuals who gather our plastic can trade it for money, items or services. Social Plastic® is plastic that has been verified by Plastic Bank.\n\nThe Plastic Bank also provides the ability for local entrepreneurs to set up and operate a convenience store for the poor, in which plastic waste is the currency. Plastic collected through The Plastic Bank is recycled and sold at a premium as Social Plastic®. The value of Social Plastic® goes beyond the commodity price of plastic: a ladder of opportunity is created for the world’s poor by providing access to income, goods and services and plastic is kept out of the ocean.\n\nIn addition to using our recycled plastic, both people and companies have the ability to off-set their own plastic footprint.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Join the

Announced earlier this year, that initiative with the FDA is aimed at testing a blockchain-based platform through which electronic medical records, clinical trials, and health data gathered from wearable devices could be better shared.\n\n\"This is, in essence, an extension of the work we've been doing this year with the FDA...exploring owner-mediated data exchange using blockchain,\" Ebadollahi remarked at the event.\n\nIndeed, the CDC is no stranger to the technology. Last month, as reported by CoinDesk, the CDC - which operates within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is chiefly responsible for preventing and responding to disease outbreaks - is looking at the tech as a way to capture critical information during crisis situations more effectively.\n\nHHS, too, is one of several U.S. government departments that is exploring the use of blockchain, particularly in the area of medical administration.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"United

This means our participants can engage in a sustainable energy network and choose their preferred energy sources, locally.\n\n A microgrid can operate independently from the larger grid during power outages; providing the neighborhood with a safe, resilient energy grid that can serve as a backup in case of emergencies.\n\nOUR MISSION\n\nIncrease the amount of clean, renewable energy generated in Brooklyn by members of the community.\n?\nDevelop a connected network of distributed energy resources which will improve electrical grid resiliency and efficiency.\n\n?Manage these distributed energy resources during power outages and emergencies to protect the community and local economy.\n\n?Create financial incentives and business models that encourage community investment in local renewable energy.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Put the power of local energy choice in your hands.","primary_headquarter_city":"New York","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2015","founder_names":"Lawrence Orsini, Lo3's Founder; Scott Kessler, Director & Business Development","organization_type":"partnership","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/bkmicrogrid","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/brooklynmicrogrid","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=tABz37jZjSE","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/d7y7n7/transactive-grid-ethereum-brooklyn-microgrid\nhttps://medium.com/thebeammagazine/can-the-brooklyn-microgrid-project-revolutionise-the-energy-market-ae2c13ec0341\nhttps://www.slideshare.net/JohnLilic/transactive-grid\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/business/energy-environment/brooklyn-solar-grid-energy-trading.html","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Exergy, Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"New York","servicing_region":"North America","subregions":"North America","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"Power@BrookynMicrogrid.com"},{"slug":"bisq","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Ronald","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.425","ref":"751","project_name":"Bisq","active":"Active","website":"https://bisq.network/","categories":"Finance & Insurance","main_category":"Finance & Insurance","sub_categories":["Peer-to-peer transactions"],"sub_categories_1":"Peer-to-peer transactions","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,17,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"an open-source, peer-to-peer application that allows you to buy and sell cryptocurrencies in exchange for national currencies.

In June 2017, it was announced that arc-net is the technology lead for EU-China-Safe, a €10 million European Horizon 2020 program to reduce food fraud and increase food safety. The project is scheduled to run from September 2017 until August 2021, and will be led by the Institute for Global Food Security at Queen's University Belfast, and China National Center for Food Safety Risk Assessment for the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), with input from a range of industry, research and government organizations.\n\narc-net was created with one goal - to protect the health of current and future generations by providing access to safe and authentic food for everyone.\n\nIs this an easy task? Perhaps not, but we believe it's absolutely worth striving for. It's this goal that underpins everything we do and drives us to equip our clients with complete control of their supply chain, brand and business.\n\nWe know that for a business, success or failure can rest on the smallest of margins. Under such pressure to achieve long term growth, companies must embrace a culture of innovation; arc-net is here to bridge the gap.\n\nWe believe you have the right to know where your product comes from and should be assured of its integrity when it leaves your care. Our platform is designed to introduce confidence in a global supply chain that grows more complex every day. Our technology makes it easy for your business to access quality data, validate products and mitigate risk.\n\nThe arc-net team has a unique combined experience in food, finance, security and data analytics.

This ratio (1kWh=1NRGcoin) always holds, regardless the retail value of electricity. The Smart Contract then pays all grid fees and taxes to the DSO from the coins paid by the consumer. The Smart Contract then validates the reported injection of green energy by prosumers using a variety of methods.\n\nIf all reports check out, the Smart Contract mints new NRGcoins and rewards prosumers for their injected green energy. Prosumers can then sell those coins on a currency market, or use them to pay for green energy later on. The currency market is where consumers buy their NRGcoins from in order to pay for their consumption. When energy is paid, the associated coins are not destroyed, but remain in circulation. To prevent excessive inflation, the minting rate decreases with time.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Smart Contract for green energy","primary_headquarter_city":"Brussels","primary_headquarter_country":"Belgium","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"Mihail Mihaylov, Technical Lead\n","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/nrgcoin","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz7N1Gh4pNo&feature=youtu.be","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum,Tobalaba","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Vrije Universiteit Brussel,Enervalis","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"nrgcoin.info@gmail.com"},{"slug":"slock-it","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.467","ref":"70","project_name":"Slock.IT","active":"Inactive","website":"https://slock.it/index.html","categories":"Energy,Transport & Infrastructure","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Energy"],"sub_categories_1":"Energy","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"7, 13","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a start-up that brings the benefits of the Blockchain - transparency, security and auditablity - to real-world everyday objects focusing on IoT applications","long_description":"Connecting all things, the Universal Sharing Network will form a financial Internet where machines can not only sell and rent themselves, but also pay for each other services.

Using blockchain technology, the platform provides a transparent, auditable and automated market trading and clearing mechanism for residential and commercial businesses to decide who they sell their surplus energy to and at what price.\n \nP2P TRADING\nThis class of Platform Application gives retailers the ability to empower consumers (or in an unregulated environment, the consumers themselves) to simply trade electricity with one another and receive payment in real-time from an automated and trustless reconciliation and settlement system. There are many other immediate benefits such as being able to select a clean energy source, trade with neighbors, receive more money for excess power, benefit from transparency of all your trades on a blockchain and very low-cost settlement costs all leading to lower power bills and improved returns for investments in distributed renewables.\n \nNEO-RETAILER\nThis class of Platform Application provides Neo-retailers’ with smart demand and supply management, along with almost instantaneous remuneration and payment settlements while managing consumer exposure to the risk of non-supply.\n \nMICROGRID/EMBEDDED NETWORK OPERATOR/STRATA\nThis type of Platform Application enables electricity metering, big data acquisition, rapid micro transactions and grid management at an unprecedented granular scale. Trading in embedded networks breaks the nexus between generation ownership and energy consumption meaning value can be derived from an investment in DER even if the investor is absent or doesn’t consume all the energy they generate.\n \nWHOLESALE MARKET SETTLEMENT\nThis Platform Application class offers rapid low-cost and transparent dispatch optimization and management, data aggregation, reconciliation and settlement for wholesale energy marketplaces.\n \nAUTONOMOUS ASSET (AA) MANAGEMENT\nThis current Platform Application allows for (1) shared ownership of renewable energy assets and (2) trading renewable asset ownership. The AA is able to buy and sell its own electricity and distribute its income to assigned wallet addresses.\n \nDISTRIBUTED MARKET MANAGEMENT\nThis Platform Application provides optimized metering data, the collection of big data, right to access and dispatch of assets, rapid transaction settlement, network load balancing, frequency management, demand side response and demand side and load management. The optimization of network assets is made viable by the near real-time remuneration of asset owners.\n \nELECTRIC VEHICLES\nThis class of Platform Application facilitates real time metering data (interfacing with the Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP)), collection of data, user identification and rapid transaction settlement.\n \n POWER PORT\n A class of Platform Application whereby virtual pipeline and roadside assistance type assets may be automated via the platform, such as EVs, and can provide a mobile storage discharge facility maintaining energy supplies to predominantly self-sufficient energy consumers.\n \n CARBON TRADING\n This Platform Application class offers smart contracts for carbon traders to assure digital transactions across organizations; credibility of asset using immutable distributed ledger technology; and transparency and auditability. It supports reporting and surrendering of carbon credits or certificates to regulatory authorities.\n \n TRANSMISSION EXCHANGE\n In the management of transmission networks, the Platform can provide real time metering data, collection of big data, right to access and dispatch assets, rapid transaction settlement, network load balancing, responding to non-stationary energy.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"The world leading peer-to-peer marketplace for renewable energy","primary_headquarter_city":"Perth","primary_headquarter_country":"Australia","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Oceania","hq_subregion":"Oceania","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Dr. Jemma Green, Co-Founder and Chair; David Martin, Co-Founder & Managing Director; John Bulich, Co-Founder & Technical Director; Dr. Govert van Ek, Co-Founder & Director; Jenny Conroy, Co-Founder & Director","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/PowerLedger_io","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/powerledger","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/power-ledger/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMqMRs34_u8","white_paper_url":"https://powerledger.io/media/Power-Ledger-Whitepaper-v8.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://web.powerledger.io/power-ledgers-wgv-project-density-x-design/\n https://web.powerledger.io/3-australian-startups-benefiting-cryptocurrency-popularity/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"POWR","blockchain_type":"Private","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum, Solana","coinmarketcap_url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/power-ledger/","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Australia, New Zealand","servicing_region":"Northern America, Global, Oceania","subregions":"Northern America, Global, Oceania","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"support@powerledger.io"},{"slug":"grassroots-economics","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.525","ref":"472","project_name":"Grassroots Economics","active":"Active","website":"https://www.grassrootseconomics.org/about","categories":"Finance & Insurance","main_category":"Finance & Insurance","sub_categories":["Financial Inclusion"],"sub_categories_1":"Financial Inclusion","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,17,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a system that lets communities digitally create their own currencies and allow them to trade on regional economic markets that are build from the ground up","long_description":"Grassroots Economics is a non-profit foundation that seeks to empower marginalized communities to take charge of their own livelihoods and economic future.

Winners of the 2019 United Nations World Summit Awards","long_description":"BitDegree is one of the global leaders in the field of Blockchain in Education, recognized as one of the leading EdTech startups in Europe and in 2019 has won the World Summit Awards by the UN in the Education category, given to solutions that improve society. BitDegree has developed a global blockchain credentialing system that can be used by online & traditional education institutions. Moreover, the system allows for transfer of economic value tied to educational achievements. In response to the Prize, BitDegree has developed BitDegree Scholarships. It is an open-source autonomous global credentials and scholarships solution that learners, educational institutions / charities and donors can use today.\n\nBitDegree Scholarships Showcase was launched on the BitDegree Platform (570k learners) in August 2019 and has already received significant interest. Learners can request micro-scholarships tied to courses on the BitDegree Platform and get it once they complete learning as proven by a blockchain certificate. Education donors can choose to sponsor individual learners with a micro-scholarship and know for sure that the learning has happened as the funds will leave the smart-contract only once the blockchain certificate was issued. This Showcase completely eliminates intermediaries from the education donations and allows for Peer-2-Peer donations with full transparency and traceability.\n\nThe autonomous nature of the solution enables micro-scholarships to become the catalyst for education donations and online learning, similarly to how micro-financing was to financial inclusion. Moreover, the Showcase is focusing on reskilling and up-skilling into digital careers, which is an enormous need and an opportunity globally, especially in the context of inclusion of the disadvantaged populations. The European labour-force also needs to transform itself to remain competitive in the Digital Age and it must do in a way that does no leave out the most vulnerable ones, such as refugees.\n\nThe Prize is encouraging BitDegree to innovate beyond what investors are comfortable with and, if won, will be used for further Scholarships solution development beyond the state-of-the-art and global scaling of it. Lastly, the Prize would give awareness and credibility to the solution for it to be adopted by the masses.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Gain knowledge and get your dream job: learn to earn.","primary_headquarter_city":"Vilnius","primary_headquarter_country":"Lithuania","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Northern Europe","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/bitdegree_learn","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuckLtuInNY&feature=youtu.be","white_paper_url":"https://www.bitdegree.org/bitdegree-vision.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitdegree/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Vilnius University","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"hello@bitdegree.org","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"Danielius Stasiulis","individual_contact_2_at_project":"Danielius@bitdegree.org"},{"slug":"dether","":"","original_source_name":"added / claimed website","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.5","ref":"465","project_name":"Dether","active":"Active","website":"https://dether.io","categories":"Finance & Insurance","main_category":"Finance & Insurance","sub_categories":["Peer-to-peer transactions"],"sub_categories_1":"Peer-to-peer transactions","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,17,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"the world's first decentralised, peer-to-peer mobile app for crypto-to-cash payments and buyings goods and services in local/physical stores","long_description":"Dether is the world's first decentralised, peer-to-peer mobile app for crypto-to-cash payments and buying goods and services in local, physical stores.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"The world's first decentralised, peer-to-peer mobile app","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"Gibraltar","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Southern Europe","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Hamid Benyahia, Founder; Mehdi Amari, Founder","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/dether_io","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/dether.io/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"https://whitepaper.dether.io/","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://medium.com/dether; https://github.com/dethertech; https://t.me/joinchat/GkdUjUQ4jx_Apxmz2km4ww","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"DTH","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dether/","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"penelope@dether.io"},{"slug":"mysterium-network","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Ronald","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.517","ref":"426","project_name":"Mysterium Network","active":"Active","website":"https://mysterium.network/","categories":"Identity & Ownership,Internet & Telco","main_category":"Internet & Telco","sub_categories":["Telecommunications"],"sub_categories_1":"Telecommunications","sub_categories_2":"Internet Neutrality","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9","second_sdg":"9","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,9,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a decentralized VPN powered by blockchain; open sourced network allowing anyone to rent their unused network traffic, while providing a secure connection for those in need.

We are on a quest to help reclaim our privacy.\n\nMysterium foundation is developing Mysterium Network – an open source software, powering a decentralized network of VPN Nodes. \n\nMysterium Network acts as a marketplace, its Open Source software allows anyone to join the network both as a provider – selling unused network traffic or as a customer –  buying VPN service from other Mysterium Network providers.\n\nMysterium Network is based on a complex architecture revolving around P2P, Blockchain, Smart Contracts, State Channels, etc. The protocol will enable the creation of completely decentralized VPN network, powered by decentralized micro payments.\n\nWhat is Mysterium Network?\nMysterium Network aims to be fully decentralized, peer to peer based and serverless VPN  node network, designed to provide privacy restoring techniques to its users and financial incentivization to its node operators (providers).\n\nHow Mysterium Network is different from other VPN providers?\nMysterium Network will work by utilizing blockchain technology such as Ethereum, smart contracts advancing their features with state-channels and evolving mechanisms of promises, combined with censorship evasion protocols developed by the community acting as applications of the network.\n\nWhat if someone misuses my VPN Node network?\nMysterium will deploy technological and legal means to make sure node operators are safe:\nI’st we will focus on protecting node operators from legal perspective,\nII’nd we will implement an ingrained reputation & trust mechanisms (based on Registered Identities defined in whitepaper)\nand finally we will develop a traffic routing mechanism which would combine splitting request data through different nodes and changing the end-to-end circuit between requests.\n\nHow much will Mysterium cost per month or per mb of bandwidth for the end user?\nCost ot Mysterium services will be defined by the node operators. Since this will create a phenomenon known as ‘perfect competition’ – we expect prices to be significantly lower than of current VPN providers.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Open Source Network allowing anyone to rent their unused Network traffic","primary_headquarter_city":"Zug","primary_headquarter_country":"Switzerland","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Central Europe","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Robertas Visinskis, Founder; Paulius Mozuras, Co-Founder, Smart Contract and Python developer; Valdas Petrulis, Co-Founder and Lead Software Engineer","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/MysteriumNet","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/MysteriumNet/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"https://mysterium.network/whitepaper.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"MYST","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mysterium/","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"Robertas Visinskis","individual_contact_2_at_project":"Robertas@mysterium.network","email_2":"Paulius Mozuras"},{"slug":"electrify-network","":"","original_source_name":"applied at Blockchain Agora Paris in 2018","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"applied at Blockchain Agora Paris in 2018","comment":"0.37","ref":"520","project_name":"Electrify Network","active":"Inactive","website":"","categories":"Energy,Climate & Environment","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Climate & Carbon reduction","Energy Certificates"],"sub_categories_1":"Climate & Carbon reduction","sub_categories_2":"Energy Certificates","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"13","second_sdg":"7, 13","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",13,7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"3","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a green tech start-up that aims to ease the process of implementing renewable energy plants, smart micro-grids deployment, transactive energy marketplaces and self-sustained smart cities development, to a grass-root level","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"We harness the power of IoT, Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence to revolutionize the energy sector.","primary_headquarter_city":"Paris","primary_headquarter_country":"France","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"Mohamed.mnif@electrify.network"},{"slug":"diwala","":"","original_source_name":"added / claimed website","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.591","ref":"223","project_name":"Diwala","active":"Active","website":"https://www.diwala.io/","categories":"Education & Employment,Identity & Ownership,Aid & Philanthropy","main_category":"Education & Employment","sub_categories":["Digital Identity","Refugee crisis","Job market"],"sub_categories_1":"Digital Identity","sub_categories_2":"Refugee crisis","sub_categories_3":"Job market","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9, 16","second_sdg":"10","third_sdg":"45,142","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,16,10,4,8,","number_of_sd_gs":"5","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a digital economy platform powered by blockchain that enables refugees to actively build their identity & skills","long_description":"Diwala is building an ecosystem of trusted digital skill Identities in order to combat certification and identity fraud, creating global opportunities for youth.\n\nDiwala is a digital economy platform powered by blockchain that enables refugees to actively build their identity & skills.

Onboarding recipients to the platform was reduced to an average of 3.6 minutes per individual compared to\nover an hour during the Ambae volcano response in 2018. Additionally, the tested system eliminated slow identity (ID) verifications\nand reduced dependency on post offices or banks to deposit cheques.\n\nHowever, there is little evidence that the direct time and cost of financial transaction between programme stakeholder accounts has been\nreduced. This is due to the reliance on existing financial service providers (FSPs) for foreign exchange and cashing-out vendors in this\nparticular implementation. In contrast, the indirect time and cost appear to have fallen due to the efficacy gains promoted by the Sempo\nplatform. Fortunately, the unexpected challenges with the existing FSP in Vanuatu created an opportunity to test a more communityintegrated\nhub-and-spoke cash-out mechanism via the ‘Super Vendor’ model.\n\nThe quality of the tested solution, which encompassed transparency, security, and user experience indicators, was found to be\nextremely high. Recipient and vendor feedback alike indicates an overwhelming preference for assistance of this type.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Much faster, less expensive, and more transparent financial aid for relief efforts","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"Vanuatu","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Oceania","hq_subregion":"Oceania","year_creation":"2019","founder_names":"","organization_type":"partnership","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://medium.com/unblockedcash","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssa-ku22w0k","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/social-impact/project-unblocked-cash-case-study/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"DAI","blockchain_type":"Private","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Oxfam,ConsenSys,MakerDAO,Semp,Australian Aid","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"Asia","subregions":"Southern Asia"},{"slug":"civic","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Ronald","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.483","ref":"123","project_name":"Civic","active":"Active","website":"https://www.civic.com/","categories":"Identity & Ownership","main_category":"Identity & Ownership","sub_categories":["Digital Identity"],"sub_categories_1":"Digital Identity","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9, 16","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,16,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a blockchain identity-verification technology giving businesses and individuals the tools to control and protect identities","long_description":"Civic’s mission is to provide every person on Earth with a digital identity that they can use to interact privately and securely with the world. \n\nWe envision a world where people can decide who they want to share their personal information with and what information gets shared.\n\nCivic's visionary blockchain identity-verification technology allows consumers to authorize the use of their identities in real time.

The building blocks of the project are blockchains and a bespoke cryptocurrency, a system of “tokens” that will both fund the development of the platform and compensate writers and editors.\n\n“With open governance and crypto-economics, we can create a sustainable place for journalism?—even the kind of local, policy, and investigative journalism that has been most eroded,” the company said in a white paper published online in October. “Decentralization is the key to a free and independent press.”\n\nTHE FOURTH ESTATE as we know it is vanishing. Advertising dollars, fake news and powerful agendas are manipulating what we see and what we think we know. Our freedom, justice and even democracy are at risk. We've never been more divided.\n\nAt Civil, we believe the certainty and transparency of blockchain technology can offer a radical new way forward. With open governance and cryptoeconomics, we can create a sustainable place for local, policy and investigative journalism while achieving a high standard for accuracy and trustworthiness. Let's begin.\n\nSustainable newsmaking backed by ethical AI, smart contract collaboration and crypto-sponsorships provide insight into what influences the news. An entirely new way to create, distribute and fund journalism.\n\nCivil has raised $1 million for its First Fleet, a diverse group of forward-thinking newsrooms that serve as our foundation.

The company currently manages over $140m worth of energy on behalf of its large Industrial and Commercial customers. We look after approximately 1,100 customer sites across Europe, UK, France, Belgium & Netherlands. Customers include one of the largest law firms in the world, one of Europe’s largest fuel retailers and the UK’s largest independent construction materials group. We use Deep Learning Artifical Intelligence models in our core offering, to streamline the energy procurement process. Through this , customers have access to energy consumption insights like never seen before.\n \n Energi Mine aims to decentralize the $2 trillion global electricity markets which are naturally closed and controlled by a handful of large players. Energy companies are currently incentivised to sell more energy and at the highest possible price.\n \n The market for power (electricity) generation is naturally becoming decentralised, in that more and more individuals and businesses are generating their own energy through renewables. However, they are still selling this energy back to the big energy companies.\n \n Energi Mine is creating a platform that matches customers with smaller generators, as well as creating a global eco-system whereby users are rewarded with tokens (Energi Tokens – ETK) for energy-efficient behaviour.\n \n We believe that when it comes to energy, reward mechanisms must have a financial benefit to the user before behavioural change occurs. Therefore, we believe that the tokenisation of the market will be the only real driver to create a more energy-efficient system.\n \n For example, if a commuter is encouraged to use public transport by the Local City Authority, they could be rewarded by being given ETK. ETK then has a cash value, but could also be used to pay directly for the commuter’s domestic energy bill, or charge their EV.\n \n Our goals are to reduce energy consumption globally, and create a token-based platform, which provides financial incentives to reward energy saving behaviour.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Rewarding energy efficient behaviour using #blockchain","primary_headquarter_city":"Manchester","primary_headquarter_country":"United Kingdom","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"Omar Rahim, CEO; Alain Richardt, CTO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/energimine","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/energitoken/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6-pIiBpQBjY","white_paper_url":"https://energitoken.com/whitepaper/WPEnglish.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"ETK","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"France, Belgium, Netherlands, United Kingdom","servicing_region":"Europe","subregions":"Western Europe","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"tokensale@energimine.com","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"Omar Rahim","individual_contact_2_at_project":"Omar.Rahim@energimine.com","email_2":"Joy Vickers"},{"slug":"benefactory","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"Seems aborted","comment":"0.397","ref":"251","project_name":"Benefactory","active":"Inactive","website":"http://www.benefactory.cc/","categories":"Aid & Philanthropy","main_category":"Aid & Philanthropy","sub_categories":["Donation & Charities"],"sub_categories_1":"Donation & Charities","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"10","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",10,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a project that helps groups grow from a potluck that feeds some friends to a global movement that feeds the world","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Benefactory grows the grassroots sector of our economy","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"#N/A","hq_subregion":"#N/A","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"","organization_type":"","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@benefactory.cc"},{"slug":"dentacoin","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.529","ref":"601","project_name":"Dentacoin","active":"Active","website":"https://dentacoin.com","categories":"Health","main_category":"Health","sub_categories":["Patient data"],"sub_categories_1":"Patient data","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"3","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",3,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a platform supports the dental community by building and creating solutions","long_description":"Dentacoin is the first Blockchain concept designed for the Global Dental Industry.

Instead, it leads to a bottom-up process of companies sharing and certifying their sustainable business practises in order to conquer new market segments and generate profit. This results in a chain reaction towards sustainability and company-initiated transparency.\n\nCircularise is a blockchain-based communication protocol that allows traceability of process information in supply chains. It provides proof for information that is not obtainable by comparing two final products or materials, like the origin, labour conditions or the amount of recycled material in a product. This information is not accessible once the product has moved further in the production process. By tokenizing information at the stage where it occurs and trading this proof and information to the brand owner or customer, Circularise provides proof of invisible material properties. This occurs in a decentralised and safe way that does not put companies’ competitive advantage at risk. Circularise provides this information in supply chains that are even unknown to brand owners and opens the market to avoid oligopolies. It thereby provides more sustainable products and lower prices than before.\n\nThe technology abolishes any possibility for abuse by stakeholders of the supply chain and creates verifiable quality standards and new business models. The result is a paradigm shift from traceability and transparency as mandatory top-down regulation risking company secrets to a voluntary business decision for transparency on selected characteristics, bottom-up, unlocking additional monetary value which encourages others to join. The resulting increase in sustainability goals of companies leads to social practices being redefined as a necessity and quality criterion.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Transparency and traceability for a circular economy","primary_headquarter_city":"South Holland","primary_headquarter_country":"Netherlands","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/Circularise","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/circularise/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://twitter.com/Circularise","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum"},{"slug":"amply","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Ronald","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"quality check done Lucas 16/09/2018\nKhalid: The link seems dead.

Service providers use the mobile app to verify children’s attendance at classes and to capture other useful information. This will increase trust in the funding mechanism and make funding available to more children who need it. It will save administration time and costs..\n\nThe Cape Town organization, which is running a pilot with South African preschoolers, creates immutable digital identities to help children in Africa receive educational services and subsidies.\n\nProject Amply strives to revolutionize early childhood development in Africa. Combining mobile and blockchain technology to increase impact and accountability of public services and generate real-time data.\n\nOUR MISSION\nAmply is a digital identity protocol that builds trust. We provide every child with their own self-sovereign digital identity based on the blockchain. This will enable children to receive benefits and services that they might have previously been excluded from.\n\nIn our pilot project, Amply is being used to replace an existing paper-based system to register children for a government funded pre-school subsidy in South Africa. Service providers use a mobile app to verify children’s attendance at classes and to capture other useful information. This will increase trust in the funding mechanism and make funding available to more children who need it. It will save administration time and costs. And it will provide really useful information about how and where services are being delivered.\n\nAmply is unique in that it places each individual child at the centre of their relationships with Early Childhood Development services in a way that is ‘self-sovereign’ and directly beneficial to them. This means that a child’s digital identity and personal data are privately owned and controlled by the individual (with some help from their guardians). Over time, their life records become a rich source of data and value that can be used to receive services and insights that will become more predictive, precise, personalised, preventive, and participatory.\n\nWith consented access to personal data and identity assurance, entirely new classes of innovative applications can be developed for both local physical and distant virtual services. This is a big deal for growing a web of trust around children, to meet their developmental needs.\n\nWe use digital identities to\n- gather real-time data and link it to sovereign identities\n- increase efficiency and quality of public services for children\n- create accountable blockchain based subsidies management platforms\n\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Revolutionize early childhood development in Africa","primary_headquarter_city":"Cape Town","primary_headquarter_country":"South Africa","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Africa","hq_subregion":"Southern Africa","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"Shaun Conway, Co-Founder; Lohan Spies","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/amplyscale","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/amplyscale","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edk-v_ORhP0","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"UNICEF,Social Alpha Foundation,Western Cape Government,SmartStart,IXO,Trustlab","servicing_area":"Africa","servicing_region":"Africa","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"Lucas in touch with shaun conway","project_official_email":"info@amply.tech"},{"slug":"smart-valor","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Andrea","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.542","ref":"726","project_name":"Smart Valor","active":"Active","website":"https://smartvalor.com","categories":"Finance & Insurance","main_category":"Finance & Insurance","sub_categories":["Investing & Impact investing"],"sub_categories_1":"Investing & Impact investing","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,17,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a blockchain startup building a decentralized marketplace for tokenized alternative investments","long_description":"Based in the Swiss Crypto Valley, SMART VALOR is a blockchain startup set to enable borderless crypto finance.

Japan liberalised its power grid in 2016, China has done so in parts and Singapore will be the first in Southeast-Asia. As more countries liberalise their electricity markets, consumers will get greater choice in choosing their electricity retailers and the way they want to consume energy. \n \n In these liberalised environments consumers still consume power from centralised grids managed by corporatised grid operators. There’s also fast growing demand for alternative energy resources like like solar panels, biomass and wind.\n \n However centralised electricity systems are lagging in innovations and alternatives. Solutions like renewable energy and peer-to-peer energy trading are still not prevalent. Without access to alternatives, consumers are not getting the choices they deserve.\n \n ELECTRIFY will enable the decentralisation of power production and bring the power of choice to the consumer.

They are excluded from better solutions due to high costs, lack of proper identity, poor access to banking locations, and mistrust or poor understanding of the banking system. Existing platforms have limited penetration due to lack of access to infrastructure like electricity, expensive access to Internet, insufficient capital to afford a smartphone, and a steep learning curve.\n\nAt Kora, we believe that technology should empower instead of displace existing communities and networks. \n \nThe Kora Network is a blockchain built on four layers of infrastructure to provide a low cost financial services platform that is universally accessible via SMS/USSD on feature phones, or with internet access via mobile app, enabled by blockchain technology. This helps communities build and own self-sustaining financial services ecosystems. By drastically reducing the cost and time to provide financial services, and drawing a diverse set of stakeholders into an interoperable network, we unlock the Long Tail of the global economy. We aim to benefit the population most in need, enriching the global economy by unlocking the capital, intellect, and creativity of the underserved.\n\nWe are starting with four basic building blocks to construct a fully functional financial system. These building blocks are built into the Kora Network as smart contracts, and are accessible to any user on the network:\n\nIdentity: Letting a user prove they are who they are, and that they did what they say they did. Secure Storage: Letting a user protect their funds from being easily stolen or devalued. Money Transfer: Transferring value from one entity to another, quickly and securely. Marketplaces: Creating venues for users to exchange money for goods, services and capital.\n\n“Financial services have been proven to help grow wealth. Unfortunately, for much of the world access is uneven and expensive. In many places formal banking is seen as something exclusively for the wealthy. Banks require high minimums and fees for opening and maintaining accounts. Due to the cost to serve and inability to prove identity, many financial institutions don’t open branches in remote or low-income areas, requiring people to travel for hours to transfer money.”\n\nDickson Nsofor, Founder of Kora Network","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"An infrastructure for inclusive financial systems","primary_headquarter_city":"Toronto","primary_headquarter_country":"Canada","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Dickson Nsofor, CEO & Co-Founder; Maomao Hu, COO & Co-Founder","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/korapay","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/theKorapay/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9V79mNzQHg","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"KNT","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"support@kora.network","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"","individual_contact_2_at_project":"","email_2":"Bryan Uyanwune"},{"slug":"crypto-corals","":"","original_source_name":"added / claimed website","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"not using blockchain any longer","comment":"0.5","ref":"494","project_name":"CryptoCorals","active":"Inactive","website":"https://cryptocorals.co/","categories":"Finance & Insurance,Climate & Environment","main_category":"Climate & Environment","sub_categories":["Climate & Carbon reduction","Biodiversity"],"sub_categories_1":"Climate & Carbon reduction","sub_categories_2":"Biodiversity","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"13","second_sdg":"14, 15","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",13,14,15,","number_of_sd_gs":"3","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a platform to finance coral reefs restoration, which intend to tokenize corals (not using blockchain anylonger)","long_description":"CryptoCorals is positive impact game on the blockchain, to scale-up the funding for coral reefs restoration.\n\nTHE ISSUE\nIt’s a fact, corals are going extinct : half of the worldwide coral reefs has disappeared in the last 30 years.

This complexity leads to a lack of transparency, with a plenty of room for accounting errors that can range from honest mistakes to outright fraud.\n \nThe answer to this challenge must be based on a truly smart grid which will be able to optimize the complex energy flows and will rely on transparent real-time energy data for its operation. In such a smart grid the value of distributed generation and storage can be recognized and hence, rewarded.\n \nSOLUTION/PRODUCT:\ni) Pylon Network's blockchain algorithm is the first decentralized, open-source code designed specifically for the needs of the energy sector.\nii) Pylon's core code is integrated into smart energy meters (METRON), which are now able to perform instantaneous payments for electricity transactions through Pylon Network's payment method – automated, secure and without intermediaries.\n iii) P2P transactions on the blockchain through METRONs offer the opportunity of tracing (and choosing) exactly when and where your electricity comes from – by certifying the origin and cost of electricity to the consumers.\n iv) The decentralization and high granularity of the energy data offers the transparency and trust among all the energy players and can hence play the role of a cooperation platform – a shared, transparent database on which value can be traced and hence, fairly rewarded.\n v) The open source license ensures that its access remains open and that anyone can use the blockchain code to develop and integrate their existing smart meters – or any other energy tool (charging stations, energy datahubs etc.) – into Pylon Network.\n Blockchain:The development of a blockchain code designed specifically for the energy sector, with the integration of different technologies from the field of blockchain, (atomic swap, lighting network ..) – is what really makes this platform unique. Compared to competitors, Pylon Network addresses the specific (and loud) problems of the energy market as well as those that are blockchain-related – namely, security, scalability and energy/carbon footprint.\n \nIn our opinion, the competition fails to deal effectively with these constraints and peculiarities of the energy markets and the blockchain technology. The most typical example (which has recently received a lot of criticism) is the energy consumption associated with Bitcoin- or Ethereum-based algorithms, on which all our competitors rely on, for building green energy platforms – ironically.\n \nCOMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:\n**Energy Traceability ** – Know -at any moment – where your electricity came from and where your money went to!\n* * Hardware Integration** – With METRON smart meters installed at the consumer/prosumer level.\n* * Unlock the smart grid** – Real-time, decentralized energy database.\n* * Open Source license** – Fast and cooperative development. Flexibility, connectivity, and adaptability.\n* * Environmentally friendly algorithm** (\"Green Mining\") – Decentralized security and trust with the development of a mining algorithm with minimal energy demands and carbon footprint.\n \nGithub Link: https://github.com/klenergy/pyloncoin","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"The energy revolution will not be centralized!","primary_headquarter_city":"Benicarlo","primary_headquarter_country":"Spain","secondary_headquarter_city":"Copenhagen","secondary_headquarter_country":"Denmark","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Southern Europe","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Gerard Bel, CEO; Agustin Roig, CTO; Markos Romanos, COO; Eugenio Moliner, CIO","organization_type":"open-source","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/KlenergyTech","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/KlenergyTechOfficial","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/pylonnetwork/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gx_NYsUK7g4","white_paper_url":"https://pylon-network.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/WhitePaper_PYLON_v2_ENGLISH-1.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"Public access to Pylon Network 'Alpha Version' (demo): https://pylon-network.org/#demo\n\nhttps://pylon-network.org/blog\n https://medium.com/@KlenergyTech\n https://github.com/klenergy\n https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZY7CDvy69VrsrBniETH9Sw\n https://www.energias-renovables.com/panorama/pylon-network-hace-publico-su-codigo-blockchain-20180214\n https://elperiodicodelaenergia.com/pylon-network-la-plataforma-para-el-intercambio-directo-de-electricidad-verde-publica-su-codigo-blockchain-como-open-source/\n http://www.fortunegreece.com/article/h-startup-me-elliniko-aroma-pou-anaptissi-to-bitcoin-tis-prasinis-energias/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"PYLNT","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/pylon-network/","github_link":"https://github.com/klenergy","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Spain","servicing_region":"Europe","subregions":"Southern Europe","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"Lucas knows managing members","project_official_email":"info@klenergy-tech.com","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"Markos","individual_contact_2_at_project":"markos@klenergy-tech.com","email_2":"Gerard"},{"slug":"everex","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Matthieu","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"Seems like there has been a mission drift, from \"banking the unbanked\" (cf.

Sparked from informal conversations between humanitarian leaders from aid agencies who were frustrated by the challenges they faced. Governments were struggling to adapt quickly enough to tackle global problems, such as climate change, and increasingly violent conflict, which were driving ever larger numbers of people to flee from their homes.\n\nIn 2017 Start Network formed a partnership with a start-up social enterprise Disberse to push forward our plan to test blockchain in the delivery of humanitarian finance. Using the Disberse platform, we set out to test blockchain in a series of small disbursements. The pilot involved the creation of digital wallets on the blockchain that donors could use the transfer funding to NGOs, the NGO could then use its digital wallet to transfer the funding onto country teams. Through the pilot, we aimed to prove that blockchain could potentially be used to speed up the distribution of aid funding and trace exactly how it is spent.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Leading for change in humanitarian aid","primary_headquarter_city":"London","primary_headquarter_country":"United Kingdom","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2010","founder_names":"","organization_type":"partnership","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/StartNetwork","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"https://startnetwork.org/blockchain","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://startnetwork.org/resource/blockchain-pilot-ii-summary-lessons","logo_url":"https://positiveblockchain.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Start-300x300.png","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"DISBERSE, TRÓCAIRE IRELAND, TRÓCAIRE RWANDA"},{"slug":"haladinar-decentralized-marketplace","":"","original_source_name":"added / claimed website","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.504","ref":"682","project_name":"Haladinar Decentralized Marketplace","active":"Inactive","website":"https://haladinar.io","categories":"Agriculture & Food,Logistics & Traceability","main_category":"Agriculture & Food","sub_categories":["Supply Chain Transparency","Food Transparency"],"sub_categories_1":"Supply Chain Transparency","sub_categories_2":"Food Transparency","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"45,268","second_sdg":"2, 15","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",8,12,2,15,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a decentralized Halal Marketplace, a community project for the world.

The protocol aims to build a common informational interface by which exchanges, brokerages, and traders can reasonably price a tokenized debt's default risk without having to rely on a singular centralized data broker. The Dharma debt issuance scheme leverages two classes of utility players that compete in distinct marketplaces for compensatory fees -- underwriters and relayers. The former are trusted originators and assessors of debtor default risk, and the latter facilitate the funding and issuance of debts in a trustless manner. Both can be empirically evaluated on historical asset performance, and, as such, markets have lucid signals with which to evaluate the default risk of tokenized debts attested to by any given underwriter or relayer. The Dharma debt issuance process only requires one on-chain transaction to execute, and is heavily inspired by the mechanics of the 0x Protocol.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"The open protocol for tokenized debt.","primary_headquarter_city":"San Francisco","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/DharmaProtocol","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/dharma-protocol/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"https://whitepaper.dharma.io/","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"Telegram: https://t.me/DharmaLabs\nReddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DharmaProtocol/\nBlog: https://blog.dharma.io","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Private","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"Nadav Hollander","individual_contact_2_at_project":"Nadav@dharma.io"},{"slug":"bc-diploma","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.463","ref":"522","project_name":"BCDiploma","active":"Active","website":"https://www.bcdiploma.com/","categories":"Education & Employment","main_category":"Education & Employment","sub_categories":["Education"],"sub_categories_1":"Education","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"4","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",4,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a new certification Ethereum based protocol, for your credentials","long_description":"BCDiploma is designed to guarantee the highest level of reliability on the market.

The founders and I had been thinking: why can’t we build an Internet that no one can shut down, so that everyone can use it without fear? To do that, the concept of decentralizing everything made sense, because there’s no single point of failure. The Orchid protocol uses an overlay network built upon the existing internet, which is driven by a peer-to-peer tokenized bandwidth exchange, creating a more inclusive, liberated internet.\n\nOrchid is the realization of many decades of work to use technology and entrepreneurship for social betterment. Token offerings are not for get-rich schemes nor are they a way to raise money when you’ve been rejected by every venture capitalist in town. But they can be a driver for technology that creates change. With Orchid, we’re building a new Internet, one that aims to restore to the internet to a place open and accessible to all, where communication and collaboration may flow freely.\n\nTHE ORCHID PROTOCOL\nOUR MISSION\nThe Internet was invented for everyone. An open platform to access information, collaborate, and communicate freely across borders. Unfortunately, it’s no longer a place of true openness and freedom. But, we can change that. We’ve created an open-source protocol with a token-based bandwidth exchange to protect everyone around the world from censorship and surveillance.\n\nWHY\nInternet access for over 75% of the global population is restricted or censored. ISPs worldwide harvest and sell users’ data to the highest bidder. Orchid is a new surveillance-free layer on top of the existing Internet, allowing users to bypass firewalls, access information, and communicate freely. Join us and help create a truly independent, censorship-free Internet.\n\nALL THE RIGHT PARTS\nOrchid combines its protocol with surplus bandwidth, state-of-the art-encryption, and a decentralized infrastructure to bring users surveillance-free access to the existing Internet. Because everyone is surveilled and bandwidth is ubiquitous, Orchid users can exchange bandwidth in peer-to-peer transactions using Orchid tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.\n\nFAQs\nABOUT ORCHID\n What is Orchid?\nOrchid is an open-source project committed to ending surveillance and censorship on the Internet. The Orchid protocol uses an overlay network built upon the existing Internet, which is driven by a peer-to-peer tokenized bandwidth exchange, creating a more inclusive, liberated Internet. Orchid Labs Inc. is a delaware company with the mission of promoting and supporting the research and development of the Orchid Protocol. Orchid Labs Inc. was founded in 2017 by leading technologists and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.\n\n What is the purpose of Orchid?\nTo make the Internet free of surveillance and censorship again.\n\n How does it work?\nThe Orchid Protocol is an open-source overlay network that runs on top of the Internet. Its fully decentralized, because rather than traffic being routed through central authorities—your ISP or your VPN—it’s instead routed randomly through a network of bandwidth contributors who sign up to share their surplus bandwidth and activate their Internet-connected device as a 'node'”Users that want to access an uncensored Internet (bandwidth consumers) pay the bandwidth contributors in Orchid tokens through a peer-to-peer exchange. Because neither the traffic nor the payments can be monitored by central authorities, both contributors and consumers of bandwidth enjoy a fully anonymous, surveillance-free experience.\n\n When will it go live?\nOrchid protocols are available in private alpha to select recipients today. Later this year, all Orchid software will be published to the open source community. Early in 2018 we plan to offer a public beta of the Orchid Protocol to help billions of users on all corners of the globe make Internet Freedom a reality.\n\n Who are the investors?\nTo support Orchid Labs and its mission, the company has raised $4.7M seed SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) from investors including Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ, PolyChain Capital, Metastable, Blockchain Capital, Crunchfund, Struck Capital, Compound VC, and several other funds and angel investors.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"A world where users own the Internet","primary_headquarter_city":"San Francisco","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Brian J.Fox; Gustav Simonsson; Jay Freeman; Stephen Bell; Steven (Seven) Waterhouse","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/orchidprotocol","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/OrchidProtocol/","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/orchid-labs/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffulU3DF5Fw","white_paper_url":"https://www.orchid.com/whitepaper/english.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://medium.com/@stevewaterhouse/supporting-a-decentralized-uncensored-internet-for-every-person-on-the-planet-5881c93be4fb","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"OCT","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/orchid/","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"ir@orchid.com"},{"slug":"atlas","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.533","ref":"121","project_name":"Atlas","active":"Inactive","website":"https://atlas.money/","categories":"Finance & Insurance","main_category":"Finance & Insurance","sub_categories":["Financial Inclusion"],"sub_categories_1":"Financial Inclusion","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,17,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a project connecting people who want financial services with the people that can provide them.

We’re not only offering savings and loans for those that need it most, but are also laying the foundation for a network that will empower a share economy for money. As we continue to connect individuals within their communities, we will begin to connect communities to each other, ushering in an age of Economies Shared.\n\nAtlas connects people who want financial services with the people that can provide them. We call them Clients and Agents. This is how they work with Atlas.\n\nClients:\nWith just a phone number, anyone can receive financial access with Atlas. \nYou can receive financial services everyday, without ever having to leave your home or place of work. \nAtlas instantly notifies you of all transactions via SMS and provides you with a menu to manage your accounts via USSD. \nYou pay a small monthly fee for services received.\n\nAgents:\nWith just a smartphone and as little as $100, you can become an empowered entrepreneur and start getting paid to provide financial services to others in your community! \nTo ensure that Clients' monies are always safe, Atlas requires Agents to pre-purchase Atlas Credit. This is similar to the way Mobile Money and AirTime systems work.\nYou circle your community everyday and process transactions with the Atlas Agent App, exchanging credit for cash with Clients.\nYou earn a monthly commission based on services provided.\n\nFAMILY\nOur family of more than 30 is from 7 different countries. The world is yours to share, and ours to shape for the better.\n\nVISION\nHistory is full of people who wanted to rule the world, but the future will be forged by freeing the world from rules. Free market principles and incentives, together with communal care and responsibility is the way forward.\n\nThis is why we chose to build Atlas using the blockchain. The blockchain is the very representation of free market meeting community?—?a decentralized technology that uses natural incentives to solve the problem of trust. Atlas is built on a system of modular APIs that talks to the blockchain and securely memorializes the data of every transaction. And within Atlas, sits Atlas Labs, our blockchain innovation hub. Atlas labs is the engine that drives innovation above and beyond the mission at Atlas, creating new blockchain technologies that are open and accessible to all.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Empowering People To Bank Each Other","primary_headquarter_city":"New York","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2014","founder_names":"Mickey Costa, Co-founder & CEO; James Schuler, Co-founder & CTO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/atlastogether?lang=en","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/atlastogether/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"http://nutritify.com/whitepaper.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://medium.com/atlas-together/economies-shared-4e14a6e93d0f","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"ACX","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Access","servicing_area":"Senegal, Ghana","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"together@atlas.money"},{"slug":"ever-id","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Ronald","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"Ronald (PB)","verified_by":"","verified_on":"Custodian Service now","comment":"0.433","ref":"209","project_name":"EverID","active":"Inactive","website":"https://www.everest.org","categories":"Identity & Ownership","main_category":"Identity & Ownership","sub_categories":["Digital Identity"],"sub_categories_1":"Digital Identity","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9, 16","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,16,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a stealth-stage company working on user-centric, biometric, global identity solutions on the blockchain.

The figures go well under one digit in the agriculture sector, where only 11,000 farmers are covered even though the sector employs around a third of the workforce and accounts for almost 20 percent of the economy, according to official data.\n\nWith this conditions, Sri Lanka is a perfect candidate to feel the benefits of decentralized, collaborative and automated insurance, especially in the farming sector, where hundreds of thousands of small producers are increasingly exposed to climate change risks.\n\nCooperation and result-oriented innovation\nThe partnership, announced at the “Blockchain for Social Good” event in London by Etheric’s Inclusive Insurance leader Michiel Berende, is an example of multidisciplinary cooperation to address complex real-world problems. Oxfam provides the first-hand experience in the farmer-community, Aon lends its knowledge in the (re)insurance market and in developing insurance propositions, while Etherisc brings its blockchain and decentralized risk-pools expertise.\n\nThe project background is also an interesting case of how blockchain can be used to improve current processes and avoid having to start building solutions from scratch. We believe the disruption is in the results, not in the players, the tech or the process.\n\nIn this case, blockchain has a great potential for enabling insurance for smallholder farmers, a largely untapped niche because of its great challenges, from accessing remotes farmers areas with no banking access to deal with costly red tape and liquidity constraints.\n\nImproving trust and efficiency\nOxfam has been successfully working with the private sector on agricultural weather index insurance in Sri Lanka for farming communities at risk of losing crops due to extreme weather. The project with Etherisc and Aon aims to build on the current system with a blockchain-based process workflow to create efficiencies, develop trust across the value chain and deliver a scalable platform to support a larger insured base.\n\nUsing a weather data index as a trigger for smart contracts, we can automate a lot of cumbersome tasks in the laborious insurance claim process, making the compensation process more effective and affordable. This is especially relevant when working with insurance for smallholder farmers, as sometimes the cost of processing a claim can sometimes surpass the claimed amount.\n\n“We are looking at how blockchain can lower costs and increase efficiencies and make it easier for many more farmers to get access to this product,“ Michiel Berende said.\nEmpowering human possibility\nDuring the following months, we will be assessing the existing setup and working alongside Oxfam with a group of 3,000 farmers to show how our technology can improve the current process insurance products.\n\nThe partnership common goal is to design a completely automated weather index insurance product that should provide low-cost agriculture insurance, with a higher percentage of premiums being used for claims payment and immediate pay-out.\n\nIn the longer term, we hope will be able to impact as many as 800,000 farmers in Sri Lanka and expand our experience to other countries.\n\nIn the words of our Aon partner in a statement:\n\n“By bringing micro-insurance, with very small premiums, to the hard working paddy field rice farmers, we are empowering economic and human possibility.”","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Decentralized Insurance Protocol","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"Sri Lanka","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Asia","hq_subregion":"Southern Asia","year_creation":"2018","founder_names":"","organization_type":"partnership","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Etherisc,Aon,Oxfam","servicing_area":"Sri Lanka","servicing_region":"Asia","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"baidya.arindom@gmail.com"},{"slug":"bitminutes","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.543","ref":"410","project_name":"Bitminutes","active":"Active","website":"https://www.bitminutes.com","categories":"Finance & Insurance,Internet & Telco","main_category":"Internet & Telco","sub_categories":["Peer-to-peer transactions","Lending","Financial Inclusion","Telecommunications"],"sub_categories_1":"Peer-to-peer transactions","sub_categories_2":"Lending","sub_categories_3":"Financial Inclusion","sub_categories_4":"Telecommunications","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"1, 17","third_sdg":"1, 17","fourth_sdg":"9","sdg_occurences":",1,17,1,17,1,17,9,","number_of_sd_gs":"7","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a pre-paid minutes asset backed token that collateralizes micro-loans for over 2 billion consumers in 70 countries","long_description":"BitMinutes are a mobile digital currency, backed by a commonly used asset (prepaid minutes)   enabling   consumers,   carriers   and   financial  services   institutions to increase their access to capital.  BitMinutes combine prepaid   airtime   with   blockchain   technology unleashing  a  new,  innovative  cryptocurrency  for  mobile  financial  services.\n\nBitMinutes  (“BTM” or  “BTMs”).  BitMinutes  are  encrypted tokens powered by P2P Cash’s proprietary Smart Token technology. BTMs create secure interoperability between disparate global financial networks, mobile network carriers and emerging blockchains, enabling frictionless exchange of value between those networks.\n\nThe journey began In 2012, when our team of Harvard and Stanford graduates came together to launch a P2P Cash Incubator to develop global Financial Technology applications. Our primary goal is to improve the financial well-being of the 2 billion under-banked people in the world through the use of blockchain. \n\nWe invented BitMinutes (BTM), a new crypto-currency that is based on International (ISO) Banking Standards and that which not only provides secure liquidity for P2P lenders but also democratizes P2P lending to denominations as small as $10. Their inter-changeability between prepaid minutes and cash collateralizes even the smallest P2P loan.\n\nMost ICOs can be risky as the they typically raise capital for incomplete projects that do not address a proven consumer market. BitMinutes are in continuous production, targeting the combined global remittance and mobile prepaid industries market valued at $1.2 trillion. Today we have a global distribution in place reaching over 4 billion mobile phones and over 2 billion bank accounts. BitMinutes use builds both consumer credit and acts as a collateral for lending. \n\nWe have signed on MasterCard as one of our global partners, issuing virtual accounts based on BitMinutes. Currently we are under negotiation with a global multi-carrier reaching over half a billion subscribers.\n\nOur Initial Coin Offering (ICO)is opened through the month of May and are seeking a few select BitMinutes distribution partners namely Banks, Micro-Finance Institutions, Telecom Carriers to improve the lives of the under-banked via P2P Lending.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Better crypto for a better world","primary_headquarter_city":"Roswell","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Tom Meredith, CEO; Morris Mwanga, CTO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/BitMinutes","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/bitminutes/","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitminutes/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://youtu.be/Si8CB9nbVhs","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitminutes/","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@bitminutes.com\n \n social@bitminutes.com"},{"slug":"xi-watt","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.479","ref":"53","project_name":"XiWATT","active":"Inactive","website":"https://xiwatt.io","categories":"Energy,Finance & Insurance","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Crowdfunding","Energy Certificates"],"sub_categories_1":"Crowdfunding","sub_categories_2":"Energy Certificates","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"7, 13","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,17,7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a platform for decentralized crowdfunding and trading of renewable energy assets, making green energy accessible to everyone, powered by Blockchain technology.

Our flagship product, the Giveth Donation Application (DApp) brings accountability and transparency to the donation space.The Giveth system enables accountability on chain & off! Every person that touches your donation has an open line of communication where you two can connect. The goal is to build a community around a cause; so non-monetary resources can be shares as well.\n\nGiveth uses the smart contract technology (Ethereum) allowing the process of donation giving to be fully transparent and embracing social accountability. \n\nThe Donation Application (DApp)\nGiveth is re-engineering charitable giving, by creating an entirely free, open-source platform, built on the Ethereum Blockchain. Our system cuts out bureaucracy and enables nonprofits to create a high level of transparency and accountability towards Givers. At any point until the moment funds are locked, a Giver can decide to withdraw them. \n\nA Decentralized Altruistic Community\n(DAC)\nGiving to a cause can be just the beginning of your involvement. At Giveth we strongly believe in the power of communities to change the world. We are building our software to encourage Givers and Makers to connect as well as discover a decentralized governance model that works for them. We are actively practicing what we preach as we model what it is to be the first DAC. \n\nWe hope to help projects use our modular system to test their innovative smart contracts and UIs with real money in a low risk environment. Imagine starting a charity to help alleviate homelessness in your hometown while alpha testing an experimental decentralized governance system you plan to use in your project. \n\nWith Giveth, you can have live smart contract testing while making the world a better place! And because of Giveth's open-source nature, if a decentralized governance protocol or any other smart contract is used on the platform successfully it can easily achieve network effect and be utilized by other DACs (Decentralized Altruistic Communities) to aid in their cause.

This allowed for the recording and authentification of transfers for 10,000 people.\n\nCompleted on 31st May 217, the project run by the United Nation's World Food Programme (WFP) was designed to direct resources to thousands of Syrian refugees by giving them cryptocurrency-based vouchers that could be redeemed in participating markets.\n\nThe future of world food aid arrived, in early May, unnoticed by its first recipients: the grocery shoppers inside a supermarket at the Azraq camp in Jordan, home to 36,000 Syrian refugees. To be fair, their buying process already looked pretty high-tech, especially for a store with a dirt parking lot in the middle of the desert. Before paying, each shopper peered into a black, rectangular iris scanner mounted at eye level, which confirms users’ identities with the camp’s organizing group, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and allows them to access a food stipend from the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP).\n\nThat’s a spiffy authentication process, but it had been there for months. What the shoppers didn’t see was the new back-end procedure. Instead of receiving WFP funds via a third party, such as a bank, the grocery store was reconciling each purchase directly with the aid group through a secure platform called Building Blocks, based on blockchain technology. Inside the store, Houman Haddad, a finance officer for the WFP and the founder of Building Blocks, watched as each eye scan led to a cashier’s tablet flashing a green check mark, signaling a completed transaction. “It was the moment when I knew this was technically possible,” he says.\n\nHaddad, in the meantime, is building up internal support to expand the Building Blocks project. He has organized a blockchain steering committee at the WFP, and he’s drawing up plans for further expansion. By the second quarter of next year, the system could cover the entire Syrian refugee population of Jordan, or 500,000 people, which would include people who don’t live in camps. He’s hopeful he’ll make a connection in Cancún that will see more organizations join the WFP’ blockchain effort. “I wish that somehow we would get somebody to accept our hand and shake it from the other end,” he says.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Blockchain for Zero Hunger","primary_headquarter_city":"Rome","primary_headquarter_country":"Italy","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Southern Europe","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Houman Hassad","organization_type":"Private-Public-Partnership","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"http://innovation.wfp.org/project/building-blocks\nhttps://davidgerard.co.uk/blockchain/2017/11/26/the-world-food-programmes-much-publicised-blockchain-has-one-participant-i-e-its-a-database/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Private","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"UN,UNICEF,Ethereum,Irisguard","servicing_area":"Syrian, Lebanon, Pakistan, Jordan","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"Lucas received an email on PB mailbox from one local PM","project_official_email":"Imad Kh.

Our platform will provide incentive for donors to \"give smart.\" Historically, charitable giving has been centralized, which results in administrative inefficiencies and intermediary burdens in fulfilling nonprofit missions. With blockchain technology, transparency, immutability, peer to peer value transfer, and decentralization, will phenomenally assist charitable giving, across global lines. Our token will be used to fund charitable causes, domestically and internationally. The blockchain will create end to end audit trail, that anyone can verify, to see where the donation truly went. Also, our platform is surrounded by an ecosystem, that ensures optimal stability.\n\nAbout DestiNeed\nNonprofits are worth almost a trillion dollars to the U.S. Economy and constantly growing.\n\nYet, the fact remains, it is very burdensome to run a charitable organization. Data management, expensive internal oversight, and a less than desirable donor pool, can each undercut the nonprofit mission tremendously.\n\nUnfortunately, nonprofits sometimes have a difficult time realizing their purpose and objectives. Historically, in accomplishing its mission, money has been the greatest challenge for nonprofits to overcome. With  blockchain technology, we know this can rapidly change. Ethereum based\nsmart contracts have an inherent ability to revolutionize the way nonprofits are funded.\n\nAdditionally, our platform seeks to continuously reward our donors to keep our community active, thriving, collaborative, efficient, and ideal among any competitors.\n\nBlockchain is the PRESENT future of the sharing economy, and we invite you to be part of this monumental change.\n\nMission\n\nDestiNeed will be an open smart contract based exchange, facilitating the space where decentralized and trustless transactions can take place, for the benefit of the social sector. DestiNeed also aims to encourage donors to use DSN to fund nonprofits, so our objective further includes supporting each of our donors, so they are recognized, and ultimately rewarded for their charitable giving.\n\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Benefit the social sector","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"#N/A","hq_subregion":"#N/A","year_creation":"","founder_names":"Cecelia Turnbeau","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/destinedmovie/\n","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgpzjgw7U-k","white_paper_url":"http://www.destineedcoin.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/DestiNeed-Whitepaper-1.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"icobench","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"DSN","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum"},{"slug":"cryptorun","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.455","ref":"140","project_name":"Cryptorun","active":"Inactive","website":"https://cryptorun.brussels/","categories":"Aid & Philanthropy,","main_category":"Aid & Philanthropy","sub_categories":["Donation & Charities"],"sub_categories_1":"Donation & Charities","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"10","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",10,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a crypto charity fundraising on Ethereum, with a 60KM ultra-run to support BeCode, a non-profit promoting tech education for all.

This will make sourcing contamination outbreaks easiers as well as ensuring the product is legitimate. We will bring together all the participants of the food industry into a single system and in addition we will also make all relevant information available for the final consumer.\n \n Through NutraSign we will place in the hands of food operators a tool backed by blockchain technology. Simplifying operational protocols, reducing costs, increasing speed in the process and acting more effectively in incident management. Our application complies with food safety regulations, established by the authorities and is a useful tool to authenticate the originality and origin of a product without the need to resort to third parties. NutraSign provides, efficiency to producers and food manufacturers, transparency to restaurants and supermarkets, innovation in current logistics protocols, as well as security and trust for the final consumer. \n \n Our solution is aimed at all operators in the food chain in general, regardless of their size distribution, scope and economic resources: farms, orchards, farmers, producers, processors, transport, logistics, restaurants, retailers, etc. SMEs are those who will benefit most as they will increase their competitiveness against large companies. They will be able to communicate more directly, quicker, more efficiently and more transparently. These will be their competitive advantages over their competition, as the final consumer (or buyer) decides where to buy.\n \n For final consumers, we offer security and trust in a product. We have developed an application for the final consumers to use. All they need to do is scan the product to see all relevant information such as nutritional information and certification. They can also see the journey their product took along the food supply chain as well as finding out further information about related products.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Know your food.","primary_headquarter_city":"Seville","primary_headquarter_country":"Spain","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Southern Europe","year_creation":"2018","founder_names":"Abraham Gómez - CEO \n Rosa López Monis - COO\n Enrique Alcazar Garzas - CTO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/nutrasign","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/nutrasign/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfr-dBCjI-I","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://www.instagram.com/nutrasign/\n https://disrupt.digital/interview-with-enrique-alcazar-co-founder-and-blockchain-architect-at-nutrasign/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Spain, Chile","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@nutrasign.io"},{"slug":"coin-sence","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Ronald","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.509","ref":"484","project_name":"CoinSence","active":"Inactive","website":"https://coinsence.org/","categories":"Finance & Insurance,Government & Democracy","main_category":"Finance & Insurance","sub_categories":["Community Mobilization","Crowdfunding","Peer-to-peer transactions"],"sub_categories_1":"Community Mobilization","sub_categories_2":"Crowdfunding","sub_categories_3":"Peer-to-peer transactions","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"11, 16","second_sdg":"1, 17","third_sdg":"1, 17","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",11,16,1,17,1,17,","number_of_sd_gs":"6","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a non-profit collaboration platform where individual and communities can issue their own coins","long_description":"CoinSence platform enables user to connect, make collective decisions, activate resources and create shared value.

It will be an unique way to invest in companies, projects and new technologies for clean energy production. Several years ago we started our work based on the vision to produce energy from renewable sources only.\n \n Our motivation is: Even a vehicle with environmental friendly fuel cell and hydrogen as fuel is not clean, if used hydrogen is produced by fossil sources.\n \n One and the most famous supported project is HydroGenial. In this project a method called Absorbtion Enhanced Reforming (AER) is used to reform organic crop into a synthetic gas, from which high grade Substitute Natural Gas (SNG) and later Hydrogen (H2) will be extracted.\n \n Hydrogen energy industry is still in the early beginning. For example: Only few hydrogen gasstations exist in Germany. In near future there will be hundreds and thousands.\n \n Besides our research and development work for adequate production technologies, project scheduling and others, suddenly some successfull Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) appear in the marketplace and we were very excited about these new form of crowdfunding. Some team members were experienced a lot with cryptocurrencies, especially with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). We put all our knowledge together and idea of HydroCoin was born.\n \n According to our concept, HydroCoin is not only a tradeable value, it is also a certificate and a customer payment solution for fuel at gasstations. In future the owner of HydroCoin will be the Hydrogen Future Foundation. Members will vote for projects to support.\n \n Earliest trading day for HydroCoin will be October 1st 2018. The price of HydroCoin will depend on market activity, availability of clean energy and willingness of customers to buy those.\n \n Our Smart Contract, uploaded to the Ethereum blockchain, manages as an unstoppable and self-directed application the proper distribution of HydroCoins. It takes care, that the right amount of HydroCoins were send automatically, when Ether is received. On BUY TOKEN page you can find information how to buy.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"London","primary_headquarter_country":"United Kingdom","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Heiko Schumann, Co-Founder & Head of Vision; Ekrem Ertuerk, Co-Founder & Head of Operations","organization_type":"non-profit organization","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/HydroCoinhyc","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/hydrocoinhyc","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"https://hydrocoin.org/whitepaper/","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"HYC","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"Lucas in touch with founder from frankfurt","project_official_email":"info@hydrocoin.org"},{"slug":"opolis","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.425","ref":"364","project_name":"Opolis","active":"Active","website":"https://opolis.co/about/","categories":"Education & Employment","main_category":"Education & Employment","sub_categories":["Job Market"],"sub_categories_1":"Job Market","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"45,142","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",4,8,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a peer-to-peer (P2P) platform and neutral ecosystem to connect employers and job seekers via trusted advisors","long_description":"Opolis is focused on democratizing the employment experience for the worker.

Exergy (a term that is also used in reference to useful energy during transmission) is used here to refer to a distributed ledger that functions on grid-connected hardware, a token system for transactive energy and a foundation that advances market design and technology in tandem. Exergy generates, controls and secures the data required to enable price as a proxy for control and optimal operation of electric power systems.\n“We are leading an energy revolution,” said Lawrence Orsini, founder and CEO of LO3 Energy. “Reimagining how we generate, consume, and transact energy. Uncovering data that will transform markets and reward consumers with better energy services, using our existing grid and adding new infrastructure where it is needed most.”\nLO3 Energy’s current blockchain system is continuing to evolve as it works in the US and Australia. The block chain will be running in Germany by year end.\nFour components make up the Exergy system:\n\n• XRG Token: The Exergy token system activates the transactive energy services to be developed and adopted faster at the\ngrid edge.\n• TAG-e Technology: Our proprietary meter is a hybrid device with both an electric meter and a computer. It collectively\nmanages energy by measuring a building’s energy production and consumption.\n• Mobile App: A customer-facing interface where units of electricity are bought and sold instantaneously at a local level on\nyour computer or mobile device.\n• Foundation: Advancing technology and policy for transactive energy by initiating research, advocating for improved\nregulatory frameworks, and investing in early-stage projects to advance the Exergy System.\n\nThe block chain component of Exergy is working in the US and Australia, with two German projects expected to be online by end of year.\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Empowering communities through localized energy solutions.","primary_headquarter_city":"New York","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2012","founder_names":"Lawrence Orsini, Founder & CEO; Bill Collins, Co-Founder & President","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/LO3energy","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/LO3Energy/about","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/lo3-energy/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz_V7kbuTXI","white_paper_url":"http://www.truevaluemetrics.org/DBpdfs/Initiatives/Exergy/Exergy-2018-Technical-Whitepaper-v8.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://energypedia.info/wiki/Blockchain_Techologies_For_the_Energy_Access_Sector\nExergy Platform: https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=285&v=dz_V7kbuTXI\nEnexa: http://enexa.energy/\nTechnical White Paper: http://exergy.energy/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Exergy-WhitePaper-v5.pdf","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"XRG","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Energy Web Chain","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Siemens,\nBraemar Energy Ventures,Centrica,PECI,","servicing_area":"United States, Australia, Germany","servicing_region":"Northern America, Oceania, Europe","subregions":"Northern America, Oceania,  Western Europe","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@lo3energy.com"},{"slug":"solar-coin","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.467","ref":"81","project_name":"SolarCoin","active":"Active","website":"https://solarcoin.org/","categories":"Energy","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Energy certificates"],"sub_categories_1":"Energy certificates","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"7, 13","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a blockchain based Solar Energy incentive program distributed in 27 countries","long_description":"Blockchain technology is driving innovation and scale-up in the energy, climate, and environmental sectors. SolarCoin, a blockchain-based digital asset and currency, is designed to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy. As a blockchain based technology, SolarCoin is global and decentralized, with similarities to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. SolarCoin stands out, because unlike these, SolarCoin ‘binds’ the disbursement of digital coins to useful economic and environmental activity - verifiably produced solar energy.\n \n SolarCoin uses the unique characteristics of blockchain technology to create a phenomenon that is:\n 1. a free, additional reward for solar energy producers\n 2. the first digital currency to protect natural capital\n 3. the first global, decentralized, non-governmental solar energy incentive program\n \n The SolarCoin Foundation rewards solar energy producers with blockchain-based digital tokens at the rate of 1 SolarCoin (SLR) per 1 MWh of solar energy produced. \n \n §1 SolarCoin represents 1 MWh of solar electricity generation. \n As a verified solar electricity producer, you may get SolarCoins for free. \n 99% of SolarCoins will be given to solar electricity producers of 97,500 TWh over 40 yrs.\n \n The SolarCoin Foundation\n SolarCoin was created in 2014 as an open community project run by volunteers and the founders of the SolarCoin Foundation, a Delaware (U.S.A) registered Public Benefit Corporation.\n \n The SolarCoin Foundation distributes SolarCoins to generators of solar electricity using verified olar facilities as the “proof-of-work”. As opposed to Bitcoin, SolarCoin is granted for the proof of energy production from the the solar installation. SolarCoin’s blockchain uses a low energy proof of stake algorithm designed to use less than 0.001% of the power of bitcoin when compared on similar scale. The SolarCoin blockchain itself is a public ledger detailing each SolarCoin given out to solar electricity generators.\n \n Foundation. SolarCoin Affiliates, Advisors, and Volunteers\n The SolarCoin Foundation works closely with affiliates who help to verify SolarCoin claims information. Affiliates are usually organized as for-profit companies, whose services significantly contribute to building the SolarCoin Ecosystem. Affiliates usually receive SolarCoins from the SolarCoin Foundation for each claim they verify and facilitate for claimants from a separate pool reserved for these services by the SolarCoin Foundation.\n \n Current SolarCoin Affiliates are:\n - Solcrypto - www.solcrypto.com\n - ElectriCChain - www.electricchain.org\n \n The following is a non-exhaustive list of use-cases for SolarCoin as a reward/ incentive-mechanism and/or through the Blockchain data layer:\n \n 1. SolarCoins can be exchanged through online exchanges such as Bittrex and Lykke\n (www.bittrex.com; www.lykke.com) for other digital assets (such as Bitcoin) and/or fiat\n currencies (EUR, USD…)\n \n 2. SolarCoins are starting to be accepted for payments, like other digital currencies. The SolarCoin community is aiming for an integration of SolarCoin as a payment network for goods and services.\n \n 3. SolarCoin offers marketing opportunities for brands positioned on ecological values and environmental protection. Early adopters and first movers are expressing the wish to use SolarCoins for payments, be it in environmental conscious contexts (organic food etc.), energy sector or NGOs.\n \n 4. SolarCoins can be used as a reward for customers and could be used as a loyalty program to allow them to benefit from the appreciation of the coins.\n \n 5. SolarCoins could be developed further to serve as equivalent of avoided CO2-emission certificates. With the Paris Agreement and international action to mitigate climate change at hand, SolarCoins could play a role in a revived carbon trade system via crypto carbon credits.\n \n 6. The SolarCoin blockchain can be used as a trusted data layer reporting solar power\n production data. Such data layer could certify solar components. This has been\n demonstrated by some companies to certify solar power plant due-diligence reports inside the immutable SolarCoin blockchain. \n \n 7. The SolarCoin blockchain can provide a “Know-Your-Device” (KYD) anchor data provenance layer for providing more security when monitoring solar power produced.\n \n 8. The SolarCoin blockchain is an Open-Community data resource. Anyone may publish solar energy data, a Global Solar Macroscope may act as a decentralized solar energy monitoring platform. This can have two levels of data, on-chain public data, and off-chain private login data for each specific solar plant added into the decentralized monitoring protocol. Some open data can be used at specific intervals for solar power production data according to geographic region, taxes (when billed in SolarCoin) and financial tools (solar energy derivatives and exchange platforms). Some closed or private data can be extended to point to off-chain logins for specific internet layer solar monitoring platforms such as\n Wattmon.live, Enphase and others.\n\n\n_________________\n\nSolarCoin was developed with blockchain technology to generate an additional reward for solar electricity producers. Solar installation owners registering to the SolarCoin network receive one SolarCoin for each MWh of solar electricity that they produce.\n\nThis Digital Asset will allow solar electricity producers to receive an additional reward for their contribution to the energy transition, which will develop itself through network effect. SolarCoin is freely distributed to any owner of a solar installation owner. Participating in the SolarCoin program can be done online, directly on the SolarCoin website. More than 1.700.000MWh of solar energy have been incentivized through SolarCoin across 44 countries.\n\nThe SolarCoin Foundation is established in Greenwich CT and has on its board Financial experts as well as solar experts and is a member of the European Solar Association, SolarPowerEurope, based out of Brussels.\n\nSolarCoin is the first digital asset to be recognized at supra-national level by the International Renewable Energy Association as a tool to finance solar installations worldwide (IRENA) and SolarCoin is being listed on a Swiss Exchange, www.lykke.com for online SLR-EUR and SLR-USD trade.\n\nThe SolarCoin reward tool will act as an incentivizer for solar owners working with the ElectraSeed kits. Instead of the normal 1SLR per MWh of solar energy incentivization, the tool will be rewarding owners with a multiplicating factor, hence 250kWh of solar energy will deliver one SolarCoin, the goal being to help solar owners amortize their financial investment faster.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"A blockchain-based solar energy\n incentive","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2014","founder_names":"Nick Gogerty; Joseph Zitoli; Christopher Altman; Francois Sonnet","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/solarcoin_slr","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/solarcoin/about/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"https://solarcoin.org/sites/default/files/slr-basic-page/2018-02/SolarCoin_Policy_Paper_FINAL.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"SLR","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Energy Web Chain","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"nick@gogerty.com"},{"slug":"flexi-dao","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.471","ref":"525","project_name":"FlexiDAO","active":"Active","website":"http://flexidao.com/","categories":"Energy,Climate & Environment","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Energy Trade","Energy Certificates","Climate & carbon reduction"],"sub_categories_1":"Energy","sub_categories_2":"Climate & carbon reduction","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"7, 13","second_sdg":"13","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",7,13,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"3","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a project that facilitates the aggregation and control of distributed flexible energy resources in order to deliver transparent, secure, reliable, and timely energy flexibility to grid operators","long_description":"Features: Our technology monitors the electricity flow among small electricity sources and the consumers’ flexible availability.

They also achieve a more efficient grid operation, increasing the integration of renewable energy into the system CUSTOMER LOYALETY AND ENGAGEMENT. We lower the barrier to entry to electricity markets, allowing more customers to participate. Thanks to our underlying advanced technology, our gamification scheme based on near real-time rewards is 96% cheaper TRANSPARENCY, TRUST AND SEAMLESS COOPERATION.

The partnership will allow Dash customers to pay for their mobile recharge phone, monthly bills, and vouchers for prepaid mobile services, as well as the gaming platform Steam, through Bitrefill’s platform. Bitrefill, which currently supports Bitcoin and Litecoin as forms of payment, indicated strong demand from customers to integrate Dash due to its low fees, and near instant transaction speeds.\n\n“Dash’s ability to transact at near Visa like speeds with our InstantSend feature, as well as enable double-spend protected transactions, make it ideal for commerce partners like Bitrefill,” stated Dash Director of Global Business Bradley Zastrow. “We offer a solution that eliminates fraud while also providing an extremely fast form of payment, critical to the user experience. As a bonus, Dash will soon be offering a 10% discount when buying either phone or Steam vouchers using Dash through Bitrefill’s platform.”\n\nBoth Dash and Bitrefill share a similar mission to help service the underbanked and unbanked across the globe. As a result, both companies currently boast significant, overlapping customer bases in several countries- such as Venezuela, Chile, and Zimbabwe- that are plagued by the effects of hyperinflation and insufficient financial services such as digital payments providers. The new partnership will help both companies continue their expansion in these critical markets, offering cheaper, more efficient alternative payment methods to users.\n\n“We service underbanked communities around the world, and Dash’s InstantSend transactions and low fees will further help these communities,” explained Bitrefill CEO Sergej Kotliar. “We look forward to working with the Dash community to make paying for prepaid mobile phones more affordable and efficient.”\n\nCrowdfund Insider asked both platforms about Goldman Sachs Global Head of Investment Research Steven Strongin’s biting appraisal of the token and digital currency emerging market:\n\n“I agree with the Goldman Sachs’ report in that many of today’s cryptocurrencies will cease to exist at some point in the future,” responded Dash Director of Global Business, Bradley Zastrow via email. “There are too many coins that have a hyper specific purpose, some without even solid projects or roadmaps. To that extent, we probably are in a bubble at the industry level, but like the Goldman Sachs’ report pointed out, there will be clear winners. In my view, it’s the coins who a) solve a specific problem, b) have a strong governance structure and c) have a sustainable funding model which allows for proactive growth, like Dash, who will be the survivors.”\n\nSergej Kotliar, Bitrefill CEO, concurred, also via email,\n\n“I agree with the sentiment. There is currently a lot of hype in the field, overblown expectations and inflated valuations. That said, I am incredibly bullish on cryptocurrencies as a long-term invention, and upcoming technologies such as payment channels (Lightning networks), that will let cryptocurrencies fulfill the original promise of being ‘instant and cheap,’ while also maintaining a high level of decentralization.”","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"#N/A","hq_subregion":"#N/A","year_creation":"2018","founder_names":"","organization_type":"partnership","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/dash-to-bank-the-unbanked.12743/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"DASH","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Dash","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"support@bitrefill.com"},{"slug":"nym","":"","original_source_name":"JAFS","original_source_organization":"Blockchain for Good","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.42","ref":"1090","project_name":"NYM","active":"Active","website":"https://nymtech.net/","categories":"Identity & Ownership,Internet & Telco","main_category":"Internet & Telco","sub_categories":["Internet Neutrality","Digital Identity"],"sub_categories_1":"Internet Neutrality","sub_categories_2":"Digital Identity","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9","second_sdg":"9, 16","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,9,16,","number_of_sd_gs":"3","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"an open-source, decentralized and permissionless privacy internet network.","long_description":"Nym is an open-source, decentralized and permissionless privacy system.

Our vision is to build a world in which any person, regardless of their draw in the lottery of life, can realise their full potential.","long_description":"Many talented students in low-income countries lack the economic means to realise their potential, but philanthropists hesitate to donate. The impact of their funds is unclear, but attaching conditionality to ensure that funds are used for its intended purpose is costly. Administrative costs are also high due to high transfer costs and the need for having several middlemen. DirectEd solve these problems by combining the power of decentralised identities and blockchain technology to provide a transparent, secure, and low-cost means of making conditional peer-to-peer donations directly to students.\n\nThis is a description of the process flow in chronological order, from DirectEd identifying relevant high schools, to students receiving scholarships.\n\n1. DirectEd identifies high schools in low-income areas. In Ethiopia, these schools have been onboarded  to the Atala PRISM decentralised identifier system. In Kenya, we help schools become issuers of verifiable credentials. We link those DIDs to Cardano wallets, preparing the students to receive scholarships. \n2. DirectEd specifies a smart contract for each high school. The smart contracts do three things: (a) specify the threshold for scholarship eligibility, (b) randomly choose scholarship winners amongst eligible students, and (c) specify conditions for scholarship disbursement.\n3. Donors pledge donation amounts to one of many smart contracts, each representing a high school. Initially, only ADA donations will be supported, but over time other currencies will be accepted as well, starting with stable coins, then other crypto currencies, and lastly fiat currencies. Donors receive an NFT minted by DirectEd, that can be used to prove that they have donated and unlock access to a progress tracking page for the specific cohort they donated to.\n4. High schools issue credentials, containing grades, to decentralise identifiers (DIDs) belonging to students. The students can then apply for a relevant scholarship through an oracle solution.\n5. Once the scholarship application window is closed, a lottery amongst eligible students decides the scholarship winners. \n6. Students register at university and the registrar issues a credential to the student’s DID. Students share their proof of registration to the smart contract, which triggers the next scholarship disbursement. \n7. Further disbursements are similarly conditioned on evidence of successful progress as evidenced by verifiable credentials issued by the univesity. \n8. If scholarship students fail to satisfy some of the conditions within the pre-specified time frame written in the smart contract, whatever remaining funds is returned to the donor address.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"Oxford","primary_headquarter_country":"United Kingdom","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2021","founder_names":"","organization_type":"non-profit","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/DirectEdDev","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Cardano, Atala PRISM, hyperledger indy","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Kenya, Ethiopia, United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark"},{"slug":"iohk","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.45","ref":"85","project_name":"IOHK","active":"Active","website":"https://iohk.io/\n","categories":"Finance & Insurance","main_category":"Finance & Insurance","sub_categories":["Financial Inclusion"],"sub_categories_1":"Financial Inclusion","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,17,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a research and development company and industry leader in the fields of cryptography and distributed systems","long_description":"Input Output HK is a research and development company and industry leader in the fields of cryptography and distributed systems.

paper-based documents and move into a true digital identity with unprecedented privacy, security, transparency and individual rights by leveraging the power of blockchain technology.\n\nIn today’s $4 trillion digital economy where money can be sent across the world in milliseconds and everything from buying food to submitting a job application has moved online, simply proving who you are to those who genuinely need to know has remained stubbornly rooted in the legacy age of paper.\n\nTry opening a bank account, applying for a government service or even buying a SIM card for a mobile device, and you’ll need to provide a physical ID such as a driver’s license that’s then scanned or photocopied to satisfy regulatory requirements. The online world is even more chaotic. The average person has over 50 digital identities, each stored by a different company or government organization in siloed identity management (IDM) systems.

The company leverages the decentralised and democratic crypto-economy to make solar power and its economic, social and environmental benefits more accessible and inclusive. Through the Sun Exchange online platform, anyone with an internet connection can purchase solar photovoltaic cells, and lease them to businesses, hospitals, schools and other organisations located in the sunniest regions of the planet. Solar cell owners receive lease rental payments , paid optionally in fiat or bitcoin , while offtakers enjoy the benefits of affordable clean energy.\n\nSolar cells purchased through Sun Exchange provide an unique opportunity to earn income while helping to solar power developing regions, supporting the global transition to clean power, and taking action against climate change. Sun Exchange solar cells also offer a convient way for individuals who are new to cryptocurrency to start building cryptocurrency wealth backed by tangible assets that are managed, maintained and in-sured. Additionally, Sun Exchange enables cryptocurrency holders to diversify their assets and convert theoretical wealth into tangible and valuable energy-generating solar assets.\n\n\nTo further accelerate access to solar energy globally, and to grow its community of inspired members actively participating in the global transition to solar power, Sun Exchange is now introducing SUNEX, the native network token for the Sun Exchange platform.\n\nWhile solar energy has taken off and quickly spread across the globe, it has unfortunately lagged behind in the developing regions that need it most. This includes Africa and the Middle East, where lack of access to solar project financing remains a significant obstacle. South Africa is an emerging and industrialised nation with large and increasing demand for energy. Its electricity infrastructure is outdated, almost entirely coal-powered and owned and operated by a state-owned monopoly. To date, Sun Exchange has focused on enabling solar projects in South Africa, one of the sunniest countries in the world and has established an international network of major solar installation companies and project developers that specialise in identifying and building these small to medium-scale commercial solar plants.\n\nSun Exchange offers its members solar power asset ownership opportunities that tradi-tionally have only been available to institutional investors. Purchasing solar cells within Sun Exchange projects decentralises solar power plant ownership, ensuring that the environmental and socioeconomic issues of centralised energy supplies, inherent in the fossil fuel industries, are not replicated as the world migrates to clean energy. Sun Exchange is establishing a globally-distributed clean energy virtual transactive smart grid, giving the international community a chance to collectively own its energy sources, maximising the potential for redistribution of wealth.\n\nSun Exchange was developed directly in response to the urgent global need for continued proliferation of clean, decentralised energy, and to harness the opportunity presented by the parallel developments in solar and blockchain technologies.\n\nThe main components of blockchain technology Sun Exchange integrates are:\n\nSUNEX Tokens\nCryptocurrency payments\nSmart Contracts and IoT Sensors\nSolar Project Insurance Fund (SPIF) Smart Contracts\nSUNEX tokens will be available to the general public and existing platform members. The tokens are designed to make solar asset ownership through Sun Exchange more affordable and rewarding, while making electricity production more profitable and accessible. SUNEX tokens may be staked on the Sun Exchange platform’s new Solar Project Insurance Fund to provide a buffer against losses from solar lease contract defaults. The SPIF provides more secure solar asset ownership opportunities for Sun Exchange members. SUNEX token benefits also include a loyalty programme which unlocks access to solar cell purchase discounts and rental bonuses, and gamification features designed to diversify and maximise impact of members’ solar cell portfolios. The more SUNEX a Sun Exchange member owns, the higher they pro-gress through the tiers and the more valuable their benefits become.\n\nThe Sun Exchange marketplace enables individuals and organizations across the globe to buy solar cells and lease them to be installed in commercial and industrial solar projects and mini-grids. Solar cell owners earn rental income directly from their solar assets, which are installed into projects that bring solar power to emerging markets.\n\nSun Exchange targets two key audience groups: Solar power offtakers and Solar cell purchasers/members.\n\nSun Exchange was Launched on Indiegogo in 2015. The platform has been running for 3 years and has won Best Bitcoin & Blockchain Business in Africa Award in 2016 and 2017. Won Global blockchain Challenge in 2017. Their model is Solar Panel Micro-leasing using Bitcoin as the payment system. This model is universally scalable and doesn’t face the regulatory obstacles that P2P energy trading platforms like of Powerledger and Wepower will face. Also the platform exists today, it can already be used, so impatient token holders dont need to wait long to utilise their SUNEX tokens. Sun Exchange received VC funding of $1.6m in September 2017. This is very important as it shows that the core business and team was subjected to very detailed institutional level due diligence very recently, and with existing funding behind them the core team are getting paid to work full time with no compromise. Project have solid and experienced team with broad experience from finance, solar and blockchain.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"Cape Town","primary_headquarter_country":"South Africa","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Africa","hq_subregion":"Southern Africa","year_creation":"2015","founder_names":"Abraham Cambridge, Founder & CEO; Larry Temlock, Co-Founder & CEO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/TheSunExchange","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/thesunexchange","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-sun-exchange/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_I_012GY94","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://energypedia.info/wiki/Blockchain_Techologies_For_the_Energy_Access_Sector","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"SUNEX","blockchain_type":"Public","blockchain_technology":"Bitcoin,Ethereum","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"South Africa","servicing_region":"Africa","subregions":"Southern Africa","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@thesunexchange.com","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"Abraham Cambridge","individual_contact_2_at_project":"Abraham.Cambridge@thesunexchange.com","email_2":"Lisa Lyhne"},{"slug":"cent-bee","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"Bitcoin cash wallet.

The Tatiana Coin is ushering in a new way of funding artists, through a Bitcoin-driven platform, which involves fans in a long-term relationship with the artist they choose to support.\n\nTatiana chose to use the model of the “Artist Coin” due to the fact that she says it offers “unique ways for people to become part of the creative process where as the fan base grows, the more valuable the tokens become.” She further explained that, “this program incentivizes stronger relationships with fans where fans gain access to behind the scenes parties, sponsorship opportunities, early releases and more.”\n\nFrom June 3rd to July 1st, 2014, a campaign will be launched to promote Tatiana’s third studio album. The amount of money raised will determine which “tier of success” she is able to reach in her journey to fund everything from breaking even on her third album, to creating the first ever crypto music label.\n\nThe Tatiana Coin is powered by CoinPowers.com, which is a new Crypto-Property Crowdsale platform running on the Counter Party protocol, an innovative, distributed technology that enables anyone to issue their own smart property or currency.\n\nRead more: http://benswann.com/the-tatiana-coin-how-bitcoin-meets-crowdfunding/#ixzz33n3qpOCQ","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"New York","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2014","founder_names":"Tatiana Moroz","organization_type":"ad-hoc project","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"Bitcoin","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@tatianamoroz.com"},{"slug":"woleet","":"","original_source_name":"JAFS","original_source_organization":"Blockchain for Good","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.347","ref":"1028","project_name":"woleet","active":"Active","website":"https://www.woleet.io/","categories":"Identity & Ownership","main_category":"Identity & Ownership","sub_categories":["Certification & Notarization"],"sub_categories_1":"Certification & Notarization","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a project involving Bitcoin timestamping, seals and eSignature","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"Rennes","primary_headquarter_country":"France","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2015","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/woleet/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Bitcoin"},{"slug":"genecoin","":"","original_source_name":"Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.358","ref":"966","project_name":"Genecoin","active":"Active","website":"http://genecoin.me/","categories":"Health","main_category":"Health","sub_categories":["Patient data","Clinical & research"],"sub_categories_1":"Patient data","sub_categories_2":"Clinical & research","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"3","second_sdg":"3","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",3,3,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a project that samples your DNA, turns it into data, and stores it in Bitcoin","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"Rio de Janeiro","primary_headquarter_country":"Brazil","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"South/Latin America","hq_subregion":"South/Latin America","year_creation":"2014","founder_names":"","organization_type":"startup","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/genecoin/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"Bitcoin"},{"slug":"local-bitcoin","":"","original_source_name":"JAFS","original_source_organization":"Blockchain for Good","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.375","ref":"1211","project_name":"Local Bitcoin","active":"Active","website":"https://localbitcoins.com/","categories":"Finance & Insurance","main_category":"Finance & Insurance","sub_categories":["Peer-to-peer transactions"],"sub_categories_1":"Peer-to-peer transactions","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,17,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a decentralized Bitcoin trading exchange platform","long_description":"LocalBitcoins.com is one of the leading peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading platforms in the world.

Each of these interactions are captured through a secure, immutable, and distributed ledger of financial and personal records using blockchain technology—in turn building the Economic Identities necessary to connect the “unbanked / underbanked” to the global economy, thus helping to lift them out of poverty.\n\nBanQu allows the unbanked to set up a personal digital identification profile while connecting them to the global supply chains they participate in (i.e. brands/ companies they work for, banked network including family, friends, small businesses, and associated NGOs). As they start accumulating a transaction history on the BanQu blockchain, the unbanked also develop a trackable, vetted financial and personal history. Our blockchain platform allows people to record a variety of transactions including business exchanges, remote purchases, funded wallets, term purchases, cash disbursements, property records, health records, education records, and credit histories among others. This Economic Identity provides a baseline for the unbanked to participate in the global economy. In return—BanQu’s platform provides benefits to the businesses, organizations, and governments that interact with these unbanked individuals on a daily basis.\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"The first Economic Identity technology","primary_headquarter_city":"Austin","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2012","founder_names":"Ashish Gadnis, CEO; Hamse Warfe, EVP of Business Development","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/banquapp","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/banquapp/","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/banqu-inc-/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3EG6sHlFoc","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://www.chemonics.com/news/blockchain-transforming-development/\nhttp://www.banquapp.com/connecting-refugees-with-the-global-economy/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/ashoka/2017/10/26/connecting-refugees-with-the-global-economy/2/#4758daf348d7","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Private","blockchain_technology":"BanQu","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"ABinBev,Shell,Sanad,University of Texas,JTI,Mars,GroFin,Fundacion Monge,Multilateral Investment Fund of the IDB Group","servicing_area":"Indonesia, Kenya, Somali, Sudan, Ethiopia, Mexico, South East Asia","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@BanQuApp.com"},{"slug":"treecycle","":"","original_source_name":"Riccardo Arioli","original_source_organization":"University of Modena","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.385","ref":"1018","project_name":"TREECYCLE","active":"Active","website":"https://treecycle.ch/en/","categories":"Climate & Environment,Aid & Philanthropy","main_category":"Climate & Environment","sub_categories":["Biodiversity","investing & impact investing"],"sub_categories_1":"Biodiversity","sub_categories_2":"investing & impact investing","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"14, 15","second_sdg":"1, 17","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",14,15,1,17,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a blockchain-based reforestation and timber cultivation programme, to plant and harvest trees","long_description":"Swiss reforestation project","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"Zug","primary_headquarter_country":"Switzerland","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Central Europe","year_creation":"2018","founder_names":"JÖRG SCHÄFER","organization_type":"non profit","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/treecoin-global/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"ARDOR"},{"slug":"archipels","":"","original_source_name":"JAFS","original_source_organization":"Blockchain for Good","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.412","ref":"1091","project_name":"Archipels","active":"Active","website":"https://www.archipels.io/","categories":"Identity & Ownership","main_category":"Identity & Ownership","sub_categories":["Digital Identity","Certification & Notarization"],"sub_categories_1":"Digital Identity","sub_categories_2":"Certification & Notarization","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9, 16","second_sdg":"9","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,16,9,","number_of_sd_gs":"3","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a solution for decentralized identity based on blockchain\n","long_description":"Le concept de base d'Archipels est simple : vérifier l'identité des personnes physiques et morales - notamment dans le cadre de procédures KYC - en allant certifier les documents et les données directement à la source : chez l'émetteur.

We are working with a strong focus on green community growth and betterment of Mother Earth. We want to create a platform that people would love to be part of.\n \n The company invests in innovative clean energy initiatives and renewable energy projects, with a key focus on accelerating renewable energy adoption across Southeast Asia. \n \n ABOUT OUR PROTOCOL\n NERA is developing a protocol that redefines the way the world looks at clean energy. Clean adoption accounts for less than 4% of global energy consumption and deteriorating climate continues to threaten our future generations. Yet there are over US$200B of green funds available in the world today and over 60% of companies today claim that they are doing their part for Mother Earth.\n \n The NERA Blockchain intends to enable a transparent and consensus-based tracking of emission reduction activities at the individual level. In turn, each community member will be awarded with Emission Reduction Unit (“ERU”) as a “proof-of-green” standard of measurement. ERUs are awarded based on emission-reducing green activities, including CO2 reduction efforts, clean energy adoption/production, and green campaigning efforts. In combining the inherent qualities of accountability, transparency and security of the NERA Blockchain, NERA aims to make the ERU a global standard in measuring the clean energy footprint of every individual and organization. \n \n The proposed currency underpinning the ERUs on the NERA Blockchain will be our ERC-20 standard NERA Tokens, which will be deployed to facilitate all transactions (online and offline) within the NERA ecosystem.

We come to slavefreetrade from all walks of life and from all over the world with a shared belief that informed choices empowered by technology can ensure a world without slavery. \n\nthe first verification framework dedicated to\neliminating slavery in business supply chains\n\n \n\nCentral to slavefreetrade’s mission are the world’s consumers and retailers; workers and employers; and businesses and their suppliers. The distance between people in these groups has resulted in a lack of knowledge by consumers about who and how products are made, a lack of respect for the human rights of 45 million workers, and a lack of clear sight and responsibility to the end of every supply chain.\n\nAnd our mission is to create a movement.\n\nA movement of people who care about the people behind the things they buy.\n\nA movement of businesses committed to more than traditional profit that includes their workers.\n\nAnd for them, there is the potential of increased economic value – doing good will be a bonus.\n\nOur theory of change revolves around re-building relationships based on trust between the main actors in our consumerist system. All of our actions aim to foster circles of trust, interlinked, to form a holistic, ethical system bounded by respect for human life and the world we live in.\n\nslavefreetrade seeks to change the way we treat the people who make the products we buy. We do this because enslavement is below human dignity and should not be suffered by anyone.\n\nTo achieve such radical change, we fully intend to subvert the social order wrought by rampant consumerism. We will replace it with aware, conscious, consumer ethicalism.\n\nFirmly of the view that technology of blockchain is ushering in a new era of possibilities for a more equal and just world, we harness the transformative power of the transparency it brings, and we couple it with what we feel is a new wave of human consciousness.\n\nThe result of this coupling? A world free of slaves.\nTo achieve this, we have developed a suite of programmes involving the primary audiences business listen to – namely – consumer, governments, investors, bankers, insurers, other businesses, and the media.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"The first verification framework dedicated to\neliminating slavery in business supply chains","primary_headquarter_city":"Geneva","primary_headquarter_country":"Switzerland","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Central Europe","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"Helen Burrows","organization_type":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/slavefreetrade","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/slavefreetrade","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ogyjqgh3AfA","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://cruxnow.com/vatican/2017/11/07/trafficking-expert-tells-vatican-summit-slavery-never-abolished/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@slavefreetrade.org"},{"slug":"genesis-research-technology-group","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.322","ref":"293","project_name":"Genesis Research & Technology Group","active":"Inactive","website":"https://genesisresearchtrust.com","categories":"Climate & Environment","main_category":"Climate & Environment","sub_categories":["Sanitation & Water"],"sub_categories_1":"Sanitation & Water","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"6","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",6,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Committed to providing clean reusable water without chemicals for our world's population","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"#N/A","hq_subregion":"#N/A"},{"slug":"vegan-nation","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Azusa","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.467","ref":"375","project_name":"Vegan Nation","active":"inactive","website":"https://vegannation.io/","categories":"Agriculture & Food","main_category":"Agriculture & Food","sub_categories":["Food Transparency"],"sub_categories_1":"Food Transparency","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"2, 15","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",2,15,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"the first decentralized global community for vegans.

UN Women’s Deputy Executive Director, Yannick Glemarec, and Innovation Norway’s CEO, Anita Krohn Traaset, signed the first Memorandum of Understanding between the two organizations today at a high-level event in Trondheim, Norway, where the guests of honour included the Crown princess Mette Marit and Norway’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Børge Brende.\n\nBy the current rate of progress, the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will not be possible, and women and girls in humanitarian crises impacted contexts are at most risk of being left behind. For example, maternal mortality in humanitarian crises and in fragile settings is 1.9 times the world average, and the number of maternal deaths in these countries represent 61 per cent of the total number of maternal deaths worldwide [1].\n\nInnovation and technology provide unprecedented opportunities to reach those who arethe farthest and hardest to reach by breaking isolation and creating economies of scale to accelerate the achievement of gender equality and women’s empowerment.\n\nBy working together, UN Women and Innovation Norway will enhance innovative approaches and solutions in response to addressing gender inequality issues, particularly in humanitarian contexts. The collaboration will also help to identify future public-private partnerships and strengthen the private sector’s engagement in generating innovations.\n\n“During our stay here in Norway we have visited incubators and met with Norwegian entrepreneurs that develop innovative humanitarian solutions that can strengthen women’s empowerment. UN Women believes that this agreement is the beginning of a close partnership that will enable us to build stronger ties between the needs that we identify in our work and the innovative products that are being developed,” said Mr. Glemarec.\n\nThe partnership between UN Women and Innovation Norway will create platforms and projects, which will include exploring making blockchain technology work for women and girls. Blockchain technology offers users the ability to build and maintain immutable and secure personal records and to directly transfer digital assets without the need for intermediaries and associated costs. Thus, women and girls in crises will be able to have safe records of documents that are essential to rebuilding their lives and for economic activities. UN Women will participate in a hackathon at the Katapult Future Fest taking place in Norway in May to explore the potential of blockchain as a solution to some of the problems that women face in humanitarian contexts.\n\n“This agreement makes the Norwegian private sector and innovation a bigger part of the solution”, said Norway’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Børge Brende.\n\nBroadly, the collaboration between UN Women and Innovation Norway will focus on:\n\nEnhancing innovative approaches and solutions to address gender inequality issues;\nPromoting women, especially marginalized groups, as both producers and consumers of innovations;\nPromoting public-private partnerships and strengthening the private sector’s engagement in innovations to accelerate gender equality and women’s empowerment, notably through competency building and knowledge sharing;\nSharing best practices, methodologies, and lessons learned around innovations to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment;\nPromoting the Sustainable Development Goals.\nUN Women believes that strong partnerships such as this, can help women and girls to design, shape and benefit from the technological transformations and innovations changing our world.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"A Project for safe transfer of digital assets for women in developing world.","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"Norway","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Northern Europe","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Yannick Glemarec, UN Women’s Deputy Executive Director; Anita Krohn Traaset, Innovation Norway’s CEO","organization_type":"partnership","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/UN_Women","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/unwomen","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Innovation Norway,UN Women,","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"Tia T.

We aim to recast what \"PHM\" and \"PHR\" mean, and to revolutionize the way we incentivize and invest in prevention. \n\nIt's 2016, and healthcare is not about data, and not about stand-alone solutions: it is about building platforms that link silos and spark collaboration. That is why we are building a 'plug and play' rewards and data analytics layer for prevention. It is an inch thick and thousands of miles wide; a global enabler of a new kind of prevention network that engages at every scale, from users and their friends to doctors to local communities and health plans to countries and international health organizations. \n\nWe are not a wellness app. 'Wellness' hasn't panned out as hoped, but that is because it is only part of the solution. Instead, Healthcoin is an integration machine. We pull the now-separate prevention nodes -- employers, plans, hospitals, life insurers, governments, wellness apps -- into a network. That network trades in a market for rewarding proven prevention that includes long term \"futures\" contracts; it readily verifies when someone has successfully prevented their disease over their lifetime; it accesses data, at a glance, that can help them improve population preventative health; it builds shared, targeted programs, as in where a city, hospital and major employer collaborate to target the same zip code with a prevention program. It can even allow two cities, in different countries, to compete to see who can be the best at proven prevention. \nWhat does Healthcoin do? It leverages everything that the blockchain excels at: openness, accessibility, tokenization, digitized certificates, protocols, scalability, trust, immutability, and encryption. Above all, though, it uses the blockchain not just as an ideal future state. Instead, Healthcoin uses aspects of the blockchain to deliberately drive adoption. Adoption is the thing we obsess about. Adoption happens when you give users, doctors and partners a reason to engage in a low-risk, incremental and self-reinforcing manner. We make it easy to join Healthcoin, and the more hop on board, the easier and more enticing it is to join. \n\nOur social impact is important, our innovations are big and our scale is global; but it all starts at the scale of one -- it starts with you.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"First blockchain-based, globally scalable platform for rewarding prevention","primary_headquarter_city":"Portland","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"Diego Espinosa, CEO; Nick Gogerty, COO","organization_type":"","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/blockchain-styled-solutions-health-care-rise/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@healthcoin.com"},{"slug":"everty","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.47","ref":"589","project_name":"Everty","active":"Active","website":"https://everty.com.au/","categories":"Transport & Infrastructure,Energy","main_category":"Transport & Infrastructure","sub_categories":["Transport & Mobility","Energy Trade"],"sub_categories_1":"Transport & Mobility","sub_categories_2":"Energy Trade","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"45,239","second_sdg":"7, 13","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,11,7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a community based EV charging network that allows drivers and charging station operators to easily access and manage charging stations","long_description":"Everty's vision is to accelerate Australia's transition to 100% sustainable transport by establishing a community based electric vehicle charging network.\n\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Charging station management for residential, business or public locations.","primary_headquarter_city":"Chippendale","primary_headquarter_country":"Australia","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Oceania","hq_subregion":"Oceania","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"Carola Jonas, Co-Founder & CEO; Jay Banyer, CTO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/EvertyAU","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/EvertyAU","linkedin_url":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/everty/about/","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Australia","servicing_region":"Oceania","subregions":"Oceania","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"hello@everty.com.au"},{"slug":"pay-case","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.462","ref":"60","project_name":"PayCase","active":"Active","website":"https://www.paycase.com/\n","categories":"Finance & Insurance","main_category":"Finance & Insurance","sub_categories":["Financial Inclusion","Peer-to-peer transactions"],"sub_categories_1":"Financial Inclusion","sub_categories_2":"Peer-to-peer transactions","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"1, 17","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,17,1,17,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a mobile-first universal banking platform that leverages bitcoin & blockchain technology","long_description":"Paycase Financial is the leading value network that merges traditional and crypto finance, providing infrastructure and liquidity to global financial markets.\n\nPaycase Financial is the #1 trusted value network for decentralized financial services.

City Chain is a blockchain project that we in Liberstad has been planning and working on since early 2017. In February 2018 the City Chain Foundation was established and development of the blockchain and software was initiated and led by Sondre Bjellås.\n\nCity Chain will be used for many services in Liberstad including :\nCrypto-currency\nProperty registration\nVehicle registration\nIdentification system\nSmart contracts\nBusiness registry\nInsurance\nCertifications\nSubscriptions\nand more\n\nThe first application for City Chain is its crypto-currency City Coin \n\nWhat is City Coin\nCity Coin (CITY) is the crypto currency that runs on City Chain. It is the medium of exchange and payment for services on the City Chain.\n\nThe City Chain is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain, making it more accessible to people without the need for hardware investments for mining. Instead of mining, you can decide if you want to use your coins for staking. As a staker, you provide a service to the community and the network, and receive staking award in the form of new coins for every block you are selected to stake.\n\nCity Coin will be partially premined and all those coins will be donated to three different non-profit foundations:\nCity Chain Foundation (20%)\nPrivate City Fund (55%) (under development)\nPrivate Business Incubator Program (25%) (not operational yet)\n\nPrivate City Fund\n55 percent of the premined City Coins has been donated to Private City Fund.  Private City Funds mission is help establish private start-up cities, micro-nations and other communities that is founded upon the voluntaryist philosophy.\n\nThe funds that are donated to Private City Fund is intended to last 200 years and each year the fund will be allowed to use 1/200th of the funds for a yearly budget. A large part of the Private City Funds yearly budget goes to funding various projects and Liberstad has been granted a one-time amount of 10 mill CITY in addition to a monthly payout of 200k CITY\n\nLiberstad's CITY Coins\nIn Liberstad we do not wish to pay our workers in government fiat currency and until now everyone has been working without compensation on a voluntary basis.\n​\nA large portion of the City Coins we have received will therefor be used as salary for our workers and also compensation for external work that is related to the continuous development of Liberstad.\n\nCity Coin will therefor be the only means of payment for our workers in Liberstad. Citycoins can be used directly as payment for products and services in Liberstad or can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies on Liberstad Block Exchange.\n\nValuation of CITY Coins\nBecause City Coins (CITY) is a brand new cryptocurrency and is not yet traded on any exchanges, there is no market valuation of CITY.  During our joint development of City Chain together with the City Chain Foundation we had to set a desired initial valuation of CITY to calculate the number of coins that was to be issued on a yearly basis over the next 200 years as well as how much was to be donated to each of the three funds.\n\nWe agreed on a initial valuation of 1 NOK (0.12 USD) per CITY and we will therefor base our hourly wage for workers on this valuation. Workers in Liberstad will be paid between 150 and 300 CITY pr hour depending on the work and qualifications.\n\nCity Hub\n​City Hub is the name of the wallet where you can send, receive and store your Citycoins. In the wallet you can also stake your coins and receive reward in the form of new coins. City Hub is currently available for PC, Mac or Linux. A smartphone version for Android or iOS will be launched in the near future. You can download the latest version of City Hub by clicking on the link below.\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Freedom to live the life you want, without big investments and costs.","primary_headquarter_city":"Liberstadt","primary_headquarter_country":"Norway","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Northern Europe","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Sondre Bjellås","organization_type":"foundation","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/citychaincoin","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://twitter.com/citychaincoin","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://www.express.co.uk/finance/city/1088740/City-bans-cash-launches-own-cryptocurrency-crv"},{"slug":"earth-ledger","":"","original_source_name":"added / claimed website","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.38","ref":"795","project_name":"Earth Ledger","active":"inactive","website":"https://earthledger.one/","categories":"Climate & Environment","main_category":"Climate & Environment","sub_categories":["Climate & carbon reduction"],"sub_categories_1":"Climate & carbon reduction","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"13","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",13,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a platform to grow a decentralized autonomous community to identify, verify, activate & deploy global solutions to create positive social and environmental impact","long_description":"Earth Ledger is a positive social and environmental impact platform that resolves the 17 SDG’s whilst making them profitable.

(Project seems inactive or has been aborted)","long_description":"Voting over Ledger Technology (The VOLT Project)\nThis project aims to explore applications of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in domains involving voting and collective decision making. There are many domains in which some form of balloting is required, such as voting on proposals or electing in charities, professional organisations, clubs, trades unions, political parties, and private companies. It is important to run such ballots in a way that the result is accepted by all parties even where they do not trust each other.\n\nCurrent election systems require trusted individuals or third party organisations to run the ballot, which places reliance on their honesty and also on their ability to secure the election against any form of malicious attack. The fact that many such elections are still run using paper ballots demonstrates that this remains a real concern for organisations despite the advantages of convenience, cost and efficiency that electronic elections may bring. Given the associated security issues around the management of electronic votes, it is natural to consider the use of DLT platforms to provide a trustworthy basis for such systems in recording and aggregating votes, since they can provide transparency and an agreed tamper-proof record of the election. The project will investigate how this can be achieved while maintaining the necessary levels of security, and in particular how this is impacted by the underlying design of any particular choice of distributed ledger technology.\n\nThe introduction of DLT into the voting domain also enables new possibilities for voting schemes. Political systems around the world have evolved complex election systems, for example single transferrable vote, where the results are cumbersome and time-consuming to calculate, but where the result is considered to better reflect the will of the electorate and hence worthy of this effort. However for non-political elections run with paper ballots this effort is generally prohibitive. Social choice theory within Political Science considers how different voting systems can affect how choices are made, and the ability to support such systems electronically enables the viability of schemes whose tallying mechanisms are more complex but which may give results which match more closely the collective choice of the voters. Hence the project will also investigate the potential impact on organisations and their governance and decision making processes through the variation of voting schemes.\n\nDLT also supports the management of more complex voting rights held by individuals. In many private company applications, particular shareholdings have specific rights and privileges. For example, the originating shareholders of a company may have pre-emption rights over the sale of shares by later shareholders, or priority rights to compensation in the event of a bankruptcy of the company. At present, for privately-held companies, shareholdings and the rights associated to them are generally recorded in written contracts and the relevant information held only in spreadsheets. At least in principle, DLTs could readily support voting in such contexts, with the specific rights accruing to particular shareholders being encoded in agreed smart contracts - i.e., automated (self-executing) performance scripts that also sit on the distributed ledger. A strand of this project will aim to explore the practicality of such ideas.\n\nAlthough the project is not investigating political or statutary elections at this stage, a strand of the project will consider the longer term roadmap for the technology. As well as considering the longer term impact on organisations through new governance and decision making possibilities, this will include consideration of how DLT may play a part in emerging designs for electronic voting systems for political elections.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Trusted and Transparent Voting using blockchain technologies","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"United Kingdom","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"","organization_type":"academic","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/VOLT_Project","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/university-surrey-bags-%C2%A311m-trial-blockchain-healthcare-voting-and-digital-archives","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"University of Surrey,\nKings College London","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"VoltProject@Outlook.com"},{"slug":"plastic-footprint","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"Quality check done erwan\nlast quality check Karsten: 08.02.2019\n","comment":"0.445","ref":"331","project_name":"Plastic Footprint","active":"Inactive","website":"https://www.gpnscheme.com","categories":"Climate & Environment,Logistics & Traceability","main_category":"Climate & Environment","sub_categories":["Waste & recycling","Supply Chain Transparency"],"sub_categories_1":"Waste & recycling","sub_categories_2":"Supply Chain Transparency","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"12","second_sdg":"45,268","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",12,8,12,","number_of_sd_gs":"3","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"the world's first global plastic neutral scheme using blockchain. a project from BCDC.online.

Not only will they have the freedom to choose their energy providers, but they can also sell their own renewable energy to others through The Grid in the form of KWH tokens.\nBy lowering the cost of renewable energy transactions, KWHCoin will allow renewable energy to expand and bring newfound power to the farthest reaches of the world.\nOur Vision: We believe that everyone in the world should have renewable energy access as essential to sustainable development. We have a vision of an energy future where all people have access and energy generation is 100% renewable and all members contribute and receive value for their participation.To get there we have five key pillars: 1. Decentralize Energy 2. Democratize Grid Value 3. Digitize Data 4. Distribute Localized Green Energy 5. Develop Virtual Alternative Grid\nOur Value: KWHCoin adds value by lowering the cost of renewable energy integration into the grid by providing a platform for prosumers and consumers to connect and configure their energy resources. As we transition to an energy distribution system that is based on a two way generation of power from distributed energy resources from multiple sources the aggregation and value of these resources present a challenge for the energy industry and utilities as grid modernization becomes a top priority. KWHCoin leverages blockchain technology and smart contract initiation to aggregate the data of distributed energy resources to convert them to native digital tokens that can be configured on our software platform and mobile applications. KWHCoin is a digital currency that converts renewable distributed energy resources to digital tokens on a unique and secure blockchain.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Advanced Renewable Energy with Blockchain Technology","primary_headquarter_city":"San Jose","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Girard Newkirk, CEO & Founder","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/kwhcoin","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/KWHCoin","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vGN-T_YNQ6g","white_paper_url":"https://api.kwhcoin.com/whitepapers/KWHCoin-White-Paper-Revised-(English).pdf?02102018","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://medium.com/@kwhcoinnetzero/kwhcoin-cryptocurrency-as-a-liberation-technology-f3ef32fee49e","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"KHW","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"contact@KWHCoin.com"},{"slug":"danube-tech","":"","original_source_name":"added / claimed website","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.417","ref":"495","project_name":"Danube Tech","active":"Inactive","website":"https://www.danubetech.com","categories":"Identity & Ownership","main_category":"Identity & Ownership","sub_categories":["Digital Identity"],"sub_categories_1":"Digital Identity","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9, 16","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,16,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a self-Souvereign Identity Solution: A DLT-based cloud-infrastructure for data transfer & management operating on a semantic graph model (XDI)","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Pioneering digital identity & the decentralized web.","primary_headquarter_city":"Vienna","primary_headquarter_country":"Austria","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Central Europe","year_creation":"2015","founder_names":"Markus Sabadello","organization_type":"corporate","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"https://danubetech.com/download.html","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"office@danubetech.com"},{"slug":"eye-witness-to-atrocities","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.45","ref":"94","project_name":"eyeWitness to Atrocities","active":"Active","website":"http://www.eyewitnessproject.org/","categories":"Digital content & Arts","main_category":"Digital content & Arts","sub_categories":["Newsrooms & Journalism"],"sub_categories_1":"Newsrooms & Journalism","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9, 16","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,16,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"an award-winning technology that authenticates and safely stores digital material (such as photos of videos) for the prosecution of war crimes","long_description":"eyeWitness has developed an award-winning technology that authenticates and safely stores digital material (such as photos of videos) for the prosecution of war crimes.\n\nMission Statement\neyeWitness seeks to bring to justice individuals who commit atrocities by providing human rights defenders, journalists, and ordinary citizens with a mobile app to capture much needed verifiable video and photos of these abuses. eyeWitness then becomes an ongoing advocate for the footage to promote accountability for those who commit the worst international crimes.\n\nProject Description\nIn seeking to bring the perpetrators of atrocities to justice, eyeWitness provides a tool for human rights defenders, documenters, journalists, and other courageous citizens, to capture verifiable footage related to international atrocity crimes. Our easy-to-use camera app captures the metadata needed to ensure that images can be used in investigations or trials. It then safely stores the information in a storage facility, hosted by Lexis Nexis and maintained by the eyeWitness organisation. The information we receive is reviewed by the eyeWitness expert team, who then seek to ensure that the data is used to bring perpetrators of international crimes to justice.\n\nPro Bono Opportunities\neyeWitness to Atrocities partners with outside investigators, attorneys, and law firms who provide pro bono resources to analyse the\ninformation we receive from app users. If you or your firm are interested in\nproviding pro bono support, please contact us using the General Enquiries\ninformation below.\n\nWhy was eyeWitness to Atrocities created?\nIn November 2010, harrowing footage obtained by UK broadcaster Channel 4 emerged, seemingly showing Sri Lankan troops executing Tamil prisoners. Mark Ellis, Executive Director of the International Bar Association (IBA), was one of the international lawyers asked to examine the video. He found that the authenticity of the footage could not be verified. ‘Watching that film was a catalyst for the idea that an app could be created to act as a tool of verification and allow the video to be admissible in a court of law,’ he says. So began a four-year effort…\n\nHow can I capture metadata?\nTo capture the time, date, location and pixel count, switch the eyeWitness app to secure mode. Press the corner of the app camera screen until it turns blue. Now everything you film will include metadata and be stored in the app’s secure gallery.\n\nHow does eyeWitness protect the security of its app users?\nThere are always risks involved with documenting human rights abuses. There is not only danger from the user’s proximity to a volatile situation, but also the risk of arrest or other repercussions from authorities who do not want information about their actions to be publicised. No technology can completely eliminate those risks. However, we believe that the security of our users is of utmost importance. Therefore, our app incorporates features….\n\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Bringing war criminals to justice through blockchain","primary_headquarter_city":"London","primary_headquarter_country":"United Kingdom","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2015","founder_names":"Wendy Betts, Project Director","organization_type":"corporate","twitter_url":"https://www.facebook.com/eyewitnesstoatrocities/","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://vimeo.com/221718535","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://news.law.fordham.edu/filj/2018/02/06/digital-evidence-and-war-crimes-prosecutions-the-impact-of-digital-technologies-on-international-criminal-investigations-and-trials/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"Not known","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"general@eyewitnessproject.org"},{"slug":"greenx-network","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.385","ref":"379","project_name":"Greenx.network","active":"Inactive","website":"https://greenx.network/","categories":"Energy,Finance & Insurance","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Investing & Impact investing","Energy Certificates"],"sub_categories_1":"Investing & Impact investing","sub_categories_2":"Energy Certificates","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1, 17","second_sdg":"7, 13","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,17,7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a blockchain ecosystem that enables individual and institutional investors to discover and invest in lucrative, low-risk renewable energy projects around the world.

TerraGreen is intended to break down the walls between energy producers, investors, utilities and consumers so that people get involved and influence how their energy is produced.\n\nEnvironmental stress to earth has induced an urgent quest for innovation in the energy structure on a global scale. TerraGreen is all about bringing reform in the existing energy supply structure and transition to a new energy system through the use of Blockchain Technology, that can fundamentally reduce GHG emissions and mitigate waste pollution. TerraGreen is an ecosystem, where renewable energies are tokenized and can be used by the community in exchange for fiat currency or payment for energy consumed. But we are not stopping here, we want to use the blockchain technology in a way that users can monitor how the energy is produced and what it is used for.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"a platform for efficient use of renewable energy","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"Malaysia","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Asia","hq_subregion":"Southeast Asia","year_creation":"2018","founder_names":"Brad lee, Founder & CEO; Hannes Klobe Co-founder & CTO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/tgncoin","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://youtu.be/4Zdw9JvXsS8","white_paper_url":"https://static.icoholder.com/files/28096/8599eb63922b567c15a8168b531dbb9e.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"https://positiveblockchain.io/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/TerraGreen-300x300.png","token_ticker":"TGN","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"","individual_contact_1_at_project":"support@terragreen.io"},{"slug":"give-nation","":"","original_source_name":"added / claimed website","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.471","ref":"216","project_name":"GIVE Nation","active":"Inactive","website":"https://give.si","categories":"Education & Employment,Aid & Philanthropy","main_category":"Aid & Philanthropy","sub_categories":["Education","Donation & Charities"],"sub_categories_1":"Education","sub_categories_2":"Donation & Charities","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"4","second_sdg":"10","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",4,10,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a project that promotes an altruistic culture in children and teenagers who in return achieve a lifetime of happiness and financial wellbeing, through the power of cryptocurrency,","long_description":"GIVE empowers kids to learn and experience at school the benefits of giving to support charities and kids in need as well as gain a financial education.

Blockchain technology will ensure day-to-day tamper-proof energy certification as well as information on how the amount of renewable energy injected into the grid correlates with electricity consumption at the plant2.\n\nENGIE will equip AIR PRODUCTS with a private web interface allowing it to directly view the production of identified renewable assets and access its own certificates registered in the blockchain.\n\nAIR PRODUCTS can then associate its green energy certificates to the products delivered to its customers.

ZEN is a digital coin introduced by Horizen in mid-2017.\n\nCrisis in Venezuela\nIn the initial phase, the firms are targeting the heavily affected communities in Venezuela. Venezuela is facing a massive economic crisis which has turned into a grave problem in the last few years. The increasing inflation in the country has resulted in its fiat currency becoming a worthless piece of paper.\n\nThe crisis is so massive, that thousands of people are starving, and according to a Vox report, one month’s salary of a low-wage employee in the country is barely enough to by a single hot dog sandwich.\n\nThis has resulted in a massive influx of refugees from Venezuela to the Columbian border-town of Cucuta. According to reports, over 2.3 million people have fled from Venezuela over the last four years to escape staggering inflation, food, and medicine shortages.\n\nHowever, the refugees only carry Venezuelan bolivars which are not accepted in Colombia. Moreover, due to the decreasing value of the bolivar, it becomes very difficult to exchange them for Colombian pesos.\n\n“Together we are providing ZEN paper wallets and education to those in need, ensuring they have secure ways to access and control their money no matter where they are and what situation they are in,” the official statement noted. ”We are also onboarding 100 local merchants to begin accepting ZEN as payments.”\n\nCripto Conserje has also launched Alpha Project to increase cryptocurrency adoption in Latin America, especially in Cucuta.\n","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Cryptocurrency mass adoption in Latin America","primary_headquarter_city":"Cúcuta","primary_headquarter_country":"Colombia","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"South/Latin America","hq_subregion":"South/Latin America","year_creation":"","founder_names":"","organization_type":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/CriptoConserje"},{"slug":"laprimaire","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Sudhanshu","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.437","ref":"72","project_name":"Laprimaire","active":"Inactive","website":"https://laprimaire.org/","categories":"Government & Democracy","main_category":"Government & Democracy","sub_categories":["Democracy","Voting"],"sub_categories_1":"Democracy","sub_categories_2":"Voting","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9, 16","second_sdg":"9, 16","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,16,9,16,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a blockchain-powered e-voting system for the citizen community","long_description":"Jean-Marc LeRoux, founder of Cocorico, built a Blockchain-powered e-voting system for the citizen community LaPrimaire.org in France.

Some Roots tokens will even be reserved to support a pension fund for individual project workers. The RootsProject’s presale of Root coins alone generated well over $200,000 for the organization.\n\nROOTPROJECT IS A\nDUAL-FACING APP\n\nYou’re walking down the street, and you see a run-down public park that could use some sprucing up, new benches, and some play equipment for neighborhood kids. Using the RootProject app you post the project online where your friends and neighbors agree to fund it.\n\nWhen a community campaign reaches its goal, RootProject or a partner nonprofit steps in and completes the work, sourcing most of the labor from those below the poverty line. The workers get paid in ordinary U.S. dollars.\n\nAn amount equal to half of the workers’ wages gets deposited in RootProject cryptocurrency (ROOTS tokens) into an innovative pension-style program for the workers. Beginning 18 months after the work, the workers could receive disbursements from the fund – converted into U.S. dollars – provided they meet conditions designed to help them leave the streets. That cryptocurrency pension does two things – it incentivizes positive behavior by the workers, and it drives up the value of the cryptocurrency.”\n\nTHE MAIN FEATURES OF ROOTPROJECT INCLUDE:\n\nLABORLESS CROWDFUNDING\nA new crowdfunding model creates supply and demand for community projects. Project initiators don’t need to complete the project or know anything about cryptocurrencies. Donors get tax deductions. Socially visible projects enhance reputations.\n\nCRYPTOCURRENCY\nA portion of a project’s crowdfunded proceeds go to token purchases, driving currency demand. The rest goes to material, one supervisor’s wages, and wages for those stuck in poverty to complete the project. The currency’s supply is hard capped, so each project reduces liquid token supply.\n\n‘PENSION’ FUND AND INTEREST ALIGNMENT\nIn addition to hourly wages, paid in USD, cryptocurrency worth half of the day’s earnings is deposited into a medium-term pension fund-like entity – further reducing liquid token supply and aligning the interests of investors and society’s most vulnerable.\n\nWe’re a startup, so for our launch we’re partnering with some incredible nonprofits that have been around for decades, and will continue to do so as we scale our operations.\n\nOur Origin\nA boots-on-the-ground local program to help the homeless help themselves; a proven crowdfunding model plus the vast potential of cryptocurrencies.

One of the significant advantages of voters using blockchains like the one underlying Follow My Vote is that users can verify voting choices at any point in time.\n\nWhat\n\nWith the ability to audit the ballot box and watch elections progress in real time, Follow My Vote's platform offers unparalleled electoral transparency.\n\nLet’s face it. No one except for election officials really know what happens to your vote once you cast it, so it’s not surprising that more and more research is showing that citizens don’t vote because they don’t believe their votes count. Understandably, these frustrated voters are losing confidence in our democratic system.\n\nEnter Follow My Vote’s online voting platform. Using a webcam and a government-issued ID, voters can remotely and securely log in and vote for their desired candidates. After they’ve selected their candidates, they can use their unique Voter ID to quite literally open the ballot box, locate their vote, and check that it is both present and correct. Additionally, voters can then watch the election progress in real time as votes are cast. What’s more, Follow My Vote’s platform allows for an indecisive voter to return to the system and switch his or her votes at any time before the election deadline closes.  \n\nThe ability to change your vote, coupled with the ability to observe the election in real time, has major implications for the current two-party system. Now, voters who would like to vote for a third party candidate are likely not to for fear of wasting their vote on a candidate who is not likely to win. In some instances, voting for a third party draws votes from one of the two dominant parties that has similar views and increases the chances the opposition party will win. With the ability to change their vote, voters can counteract this vote-splitting effect and shake up the current two-party system.  \n\nFollow My Vote’s platform offers convenience which will likely improve voter turnout among younger generations and provide troops abroad, the elderly, and the disabled a viable alternative to current voting methods. Democracy can’t function if almost half of citizens aren’t voting; and in this regard Follow My Vote is striving to restore the democratic tradition.  \n\nAnother advantage Follow My Vote’s system offers is cost-effectiveness. In the United States, millions of dollars of taxpayer money are spent on line items such as printing ballots and mailing voter information alone. These are unnecessary costs that will be reduced over time by moving voting online, as Follow My Vote plans to do.  \n\nFollow My Vote's software comes with the security of blockchain technology and is open-source so that anyone can audit the software’s code.  Keep reading to learn more about blockchain technology and why we believe that decentralization is the key to secure online voting.

In 2016 alone, it has been estimated that $2.8bn was disbursed through cash and vouchers.\n\nThe term “cash transfer programming” describes all the various mechanisms of cash transfers, including cash-for-work and vouchers, used to implement programs. While cash transfer is a methodology used to achieve program goals – not a program aim itself – the term “cash transfer programming” has been widely adopted as the overall description for any use of these mechanisms in field programs.\n\nSince the advent of Bitcoin in 2008, social innovators have striven to leverage cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies to develop faster, cheaper remittances, new solutions in micro-finance, and a whole host of CTP solutions. However, there is little unity across the social sector to scale these solutions in real experiments and best determine which can affect the most positive change.\n\nThe Bifröst Initiative, initially developed by ConsenSys Social Impact, MakerDao, and Dether, is a nonprofit consortium of blockchain companies and NGOs seeking to affect positive change in the evolution of cash transfer programming by using cryptocurrency and blockchain technology.

Fummi enables authorized payments and access to benefits.\n\nFummi\nFummi, Blockchain for Change’s first product, is a mobile application designed to provide low-cost financial services through cooperative purchasing partnerships for low-income and underserved individuals. These interactions use what we call a SmartID: a proprietary protocol for enabling a certified authority to verify identity on the blockchain. This method of verification called the Change Pass verifies a user’s access to the Fummi marketplace and enables secure transactions and safe storage of money and information.\n\nChange Coin\nThe Change Coin is an ERC 20 token that is used as a currency within the Fummi ecosystem. The Change Coin functions as an access point and transaction mechanism between users, service providers, and the Fummi\nplatform. Within that system, the Change Coin is set up to encourage value-creating activity via behavioral incentives. For example, when a user’s SmartID is stored on the platform/blockchain, the user receives a reward of 30 Change Coins for successfully onboarding onto the platform.\n\nFummi harnesses blockchain technology to redefine the usage of digital identity for financial services. These financial services provide low-cost specialized interactions for users opening the doors to the digital economy. \nService providers have access to a cooperative network, which grants organizational transparency and auditability (which enables low-cost services). Due to the inherent fraud prevention and management of encrypted data on the permitted blockchain, service providers are incentivized to secure their users’ data with our SmartID. Originators of user data are rewarded in Change Coin when other service providers utilize the user IDs for services. \n\nUsers use their SmartID to interact and transact with providers. This identity permits users to store money safely, access new opportunities such as building a alternative credit score, and getting discounted services from service providers. The record of interactions itself drives the Fummi attestation strategy, validating the SmartID data and applicability. The embedded Fummi SmartWallet (Users’ secure and protected record of accountability and transaction history), further offers a mobile financial services tool, which operates much like a more flexible bank account.

Consequently, as sentiment is changing toward solving the problem, all the parties - the government, oil companies and the community - no longer trust each other.\n\nThis presented the opportunity to experiment with the blockchain at the community level. \"We have their trust, and that is what is most important at the moment,\" said SI CEO Chinyere Nnadi.\n\nAs such, Sustainability International is planning to launch multiple controlled pilots in one village over the next year.

Their aim is to use the distributed ledger technology for the solution of many social problems that fester post-apartheid Africa.\n\nOver three years, the company developed several projects. The main one is Amply, a set of blockchain implementations that will allow the government of South Africa to manage Early Childhood Developments Services better.\n\nEarly Childhood Development Services is a network of state-funded special centres that help children from the lower strata of South African society to socialise, foster various skills and enter state schools. According to official data, Early Childhood Development centres provide communities with different services from basic nutrition assistance to teacher development programs.\n\nAmply project will use a distributed ledger to improve the documentation system in the network of state-coordinated centres.\n\n“Amply is using blockchain technology to improve Early Childhood Development (ECD) services in South Africa. Using blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts, we prototyped a system that will help strengthen the current registration, contracting, information and management systems,” states the company.\n\nIn the following year, 9needs will conduct a test use of blockchain at 50 ECD centres in South Africa. The company applied for a newly-established UNICEF grant program and won $100,000. 9needs will invest the money in the implementation of the project.\n\nThis is the first-ever investment into a blockchain company through the UNICEF Innovation Fund, which is\n\n“…A new way of doing business at the UN; combining the approach of Silicon Valley venture funds with the needs of UNICEF programme countries. The Fund allows us to prototype technology solutions, as well as expand our networks of open source collaborators to improve children’s lives,” explains Cynthia McCaffrey, Director of the UNICEF Office of Innovation.\n\nPreviously, the international organisation declared its readiness to experiment with the blockchain technology. Now it chose 9needs for the first investment.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Creating healthier life for us all.","primary_headquarter_city":"Cape Town","primary_headquarter_country":"South Africa","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Africa","hq_subregion":"Southern Africa","year_creation":"2012","founder_names":"Shaun Conway, Founder","organization_type":"non-profit","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/trustlabtech?lang=en","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/amplyscale/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"http://disrupt-africa.com/2016/11/sa-startup-backed-by-unicef-innovation-fund/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Unicef Innovation","servicing_area":"South Africa","servicing_region":"Africa","subregions":"Southern Africa","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"Khalid 02/03/2020: Website down."},{"slug":"world-peace-coin","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.43","ref":"98","project_name":"World Peace Coin","active":"Inactive","website":"https://worldpeacecoin.io/","categories":"Aid & Philanthropy","main_category":"Aid & Philanthropy","sub_categories":["Donation & Charities"],"sub_categories_1":"Donation & Charities","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"10","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",10,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a cryptocurrency that aims to route out the world poverty","long_description":"Your investement will save the world.

Unlike physical cash, these funds can’t be lost or stolen – and they can’t be easily used to perpetuate substance abuse.\nOur goal was to provide an easy way for disadvantaged and homeless individuals to better their lives. With fewer concerns about affording life’s basic necessities, DGP “clients” found themselves in a much better position to get off the streets and become vibrant, contributing members of our community.\nTo learn more about the unique concepts, opportunities, and challenges related to DGP, view our White Paper.

This data, which Akiri never stores, spans the entire spectrum of health and medical information. Akiri supports security, identification, authentication, compliance, analytics, and applications.\n\nHOW DOES THE SYSTEM WORK?\n \nAkiri Switch acts as a private networking service. It enables secure and compliant transport of health data. It operates as a subscription network. And it verifies the sources and destinations of data in real time. Akiri Switch does not store data. Ever.\n\nWHICH COMPANIES CAN JOIN THE NETWORK?\n \nSubscribers can include any healthcare provider, health insurance payer, pharmaceutical company, health technology company, or healthcare organization. Both Health2047 (the American Medical Association's innovation enterprise) and Celgene (a global pharmaceutical company) are already collaborating with Akiri.\n\nWHO IS BACKING AKIRI?\nAkiri (first incorporated as \"Health2047 SwitchCo, Inc.\") received a $10 million Series A investment from Health2047.\n\nWHAT IS AKIRI’S BUSINESS MODEL?\nAkiri will build, manage, operate, and maintain the Akiri Switch network. Partners can sell solutions and services on top of the network. Akiri itself will offer a portfolio of products and services to help clients maximize the value of the network and protocol.\n\nDOES AKIRI SWITCH STORE DATA OR MANAGE ACCOUNTS?\n \nNo, Akiri Switch does not store data of any type from patients, physicians, providers, or payers. Nor does Akiri manage accounts on behalf of any person, group, or company. Instead, we enable the secure method of transferring health-related data.\n\nIS AKIRI SWITCH A NETWORK OR A PROTOCOL?\n \nAkiri Switch is both a network and a protocol. As a network, Akiri does three things. First, it sets policies and configures data layers. Second, it imbeds security in every transfer. Third, it manages detection, authorization, and compliance. As a protocol, Akiri authorizes anyone with appropriate rights, which are assessed in the control layer, to communicate or transfer data.\n\nIS AKIRI AN HIE, AN ETL, OR AN EMR?\nNo, Akiri and Akiri Switch is not a health information exchange (HIE); an extract, transform, load (ETL) process; or an electronic medical record (EMR) system. Instead, Akiri is a network for facilitating the flow of healthcare data as well as the protocol for transferring the data in real time.\n\nWHAT HEALTHCARE DATA DOES AKIRI SUPPORT?\nAkiri Switch supports information contained in or metadata from any source related to health. This may include any information from or for test results, clinical trials, fitness equipment, prescriptions, or thousands of other sources.\n\nIS AKIRI SWITCH SIMILAR TO SWIFT MESSAGING?\nYes, in several ways, Akiri is similar to SWIFT's messaging service for financial institutions. SWIFT enables automated financial communication among subscribers at more than 11,000 financial institutions. Akiri does the same for healthcare data among subscribers. Like SWIFT, Akiri will not store any data.\n\nDOES AKIRI USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?\nAkiri leverages blockchain principles. Blockchain is a distributed digital record or ledger, similar to a database, with built-in safeguards to ensure that only people authorized do so can make changes to the data. Akiri does not store data. Instead, it’s a network for securely transmitting information through a standardized system of codes","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Trusted networks for health data","primary_headquarter_city":"San Francisco","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2018","founder_names":"Douglass Given MD, Chairman; Daphne Li, Chief Operating Office","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/akiri_switch","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/akiri.switch/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2018/01/03/akiri-switch-blockchain-health-care.html","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"United States, Canada","servicing_region":"Northern America","subregions":"Northern America","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@akiri.com\n akiri@sterlingpr.com"},{"slug":"solar-dao","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.433","ref":"34","project_name":"SolarDAO","active":"Inactive","website":"https://solardao.me/","categories":"Energy","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Energy certificates"],"sub_categories_1":"Energy certificates","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"7, 13","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a blockchain platform to fund PV solar plants across the globe.

This will be accomplished through selling constructed PVS plants and refinancing the construction of new ones with larger capacity.\n Solar DAO utilizes the Ethereum blockchain, which:\n 1. Provides its users with the opportunity to buy DAO shares (tokens), own and trade them anonymously, and acquire dividends dependent on the results of their work.\n 2. Secures the transparency of all processes related to the PVS construction.\n For the purpose of the project, we will create smart contracts and issue tokens, which will facilitate dividend payment, without disclosing the identity of the token owner.\n Solar DAO will raise funds by means of Initial Coin Offer (ICO).","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Become a PV Solar Plant co-Owner","primary_headquarter_city":"Tel Aviv","primary_headquarter_country":"Israel","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Middle east","hq_subregion":"Middle east","year_creation":"","founder_names":"Dmitriy Solodukha, Founder & CEO; Oleg Solodukha Co-Founder & CTO","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/solardao","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/solar.dao/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlbuhei-jrk","white_paper_url":"https://solardao.me/files/wpeng.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"SDAO","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"hi@solardao.me"},{"slug":"enervalis","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.417","ref":"580","project_name":"Enervalis","active":"Active","website":"https://www.enervalis.com/","categories":"Energy","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Energy Trade","Energy Certificates"],"sub_categories_1":"Energy","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"7, 13","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"the operating system of the future energy networks to support mass market energy services to enable maximal green energy","long_description":"Enervalis believes that close to 100% green energy is possible by mid century, but this brings high imbalans of supply and demand with it and accompanying costs and thus de-favouring green energy penetration.

(Project seems inactive or has been aborted)","long_description":"RadioYo is building an open source blockchain-based broadcasting and services platform where developers, consumers, podcasters, service providers and advertisers can openly collaborate, track ownership of content and content creators can be rewarded for their work. With this move, RadioYo is demonstrating its commitment to transparency and an open internet.\n\nOur vision is to have an open source blockchain-based broadcasting and services platform where developers, consumers, podcasters, service providers and advertisers can openly collaborate, track ownership of content or rewarding content creators. With the RAO, a new cryptocurrency at its center, RadioYo is building out a new model that enriches and transforms the relationship with consumers such that they consume more flavors of content across various media and enjoy more experiences in the presence of our brand in the real world.\n\nInstead of trying to profit by stealing a little bit of attention/ engagement through playing ads, or selling \"hosting solutions\", RadioYo is using the RAO to reward 'wanted' behavior and 'desired' features.\n\nPodcasters, online broadcasters, independent media and online publishers face a range of pressures every day. Funding, competition for listeners, press freedom, copyright infringement and producing the most remarkable programming possible weigh on people's minds every day. RadioYo is laying the groundwork for a new age of ownership, tracking, content sharing and creation that is engaging, sustainable, borderless, and fair to all stakeholders.\n\nWe're often asked how will RAO get its value? We think the RAO's value is derived in multiple ways: If you're a person who has watched RadioYo grow and wants to support it's continued growth by contributing to it, a la contributing to a KickStarter campaign, then you can do that. Alternatively, if you are interested in transparency and an open internet and want to benefit from the products and services available to you within the RadioYo ecosystem, then you can do that, too. (Ideally we hope people will participate in the ICO of the RAO for both reasons!)\n\nHere are a few examples of how developers, consumers, podcasters, service providers and advertisers would use the RAO within RadioYo’s platform.\n\n1. Monetization of Private Shows – Today, RadioYo Hosts can currently create private and public shows. Private shows allow \"influencer\" Hosts to create a walled off community. Hosts could use this feature as a call to action to engage their listeners.\n\n2. User Generated Content – The RAO economy can incentivize content creation by rewarding creators. By allowing anyone to create content,\ni.e., hosts, musicians, voice-over talent, artists, journalists, and authors, can be rewarded. RadioYo expects more consumers to participate and create content. This open market concept creates competition for higher-quality content and ultimately creates a better community.\n\n3. Tipping – Consumers can tip content creators for content they like,\ni.e., an episode, music, comment or article, and even service providers for something as simple as audio editing or post production. As an example, a consumer in a country where censorship flourishes can be rewarded for voting, sharing, commenting, publishing, etc.\n\n4. Branding – RadioYo provides a new way for brands to directly engage consumers. Brands can reward users for completing simple tasks. This can include signing up for an advertiser's service, i.e., a Netflix account, answering survey questions, creating themed content, curating content or interacting with brand-sponsored audios/engagements.\n\nRadioYo wants its legacy to be in the construction of a new blockchain-based broadcasting and services platform for podcasters, online broadcasters, independent media and online publishers. This platform will be open and sustainable while putting the global community first.\n\nIn this new world order, RadioYo is a participant rather than a landlord. With the aim of fostering a vibrant economy, the company pledges to promote products and services from the platform to its global community of users, while demonstrating its commitment to transparency and an open Internet.\nBlockchain:ERC20, Ethereum","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"RadioYo…where you run the show.","primary_headquarter_city":"Wilmington","primary_headquarter_country":"Germany","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Central Europe","year_creation":"2016","founder_names":"Steven Blinn, Founder","organization_type":"open-source","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/radioyofm","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/radioyofm","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuXosDXG7II","white_paper_url":"https://rao.radioyo.fm/Content/whitepaper/RadioYo%20ICO%20(RAO)%20White%20Paper.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/RadioYo/\nMedium: https://medium.com/@radioyo\nGithub: https://github.com/RadioYoFM/ICO_smartcontract\nSlack: https://radioyo.slack.com\nTelegram: https://t.me/joinchat/AAAAAEMBG4bGWaQGuDkstg","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"RAO","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Global","servicing_region":"Global","subregions":"Global","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@radioyo.fm"},{"slug":"solara","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.342","ref":"468","project_name":"Solara","active":"Inactive","website":"https://solara.io","categories":"Energy","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Energy Certificates"],"sub_categories_1":"Energy Certificates","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"7, 13","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a company aiming to enable and establish a provable green energy ecosystem by utilising the latest in cryptography and Internet of Things technology including our SOLARA HARDWARE MODULES (SHMs)","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Clean Energy Blockchain Network","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"Armenia","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Eastern Europe"},{"slug":"human-coin","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.355","ref":"456","project_name":"Human Coin","active":"Inactive","website":"https://www.humancoin.net/","categories":"Aid & Philanthropy","main_category":"Aid & Philanthropy","sub_categories":["Donation & Charities"],"sub_categories_1":"Donation & Charities","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"10","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",10,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a revolutionary platform bringing about the synergy of philanthropy industry, retail e-commerce and cryptocurrency markets, fuelled by the Proof of Charity mining protocol","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"the cryptocurrency of kindness","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"#N/A","hq_subregion":"#N/A","year_creation":"","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"http://docs.humancoin.net/HumanCoin_whitepaper_en.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"http://docs.humancoin.net/humancoin_pitchdeck.pdf"},{"slug":"our-roots","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"*** Project seems to be inactive ***","comment":"0.393","ref":"309","project_name":"Our Roots","active":"Inactive","website":"https://www.ourroots.life/","categories":"Agriculture & Food,Logistics & Traceability","main_category":"Agriculture & Food","sub_categories":["Farming","Supply Chain Transparency"],"sub_categories_1":"Farming","sub_categories_2":"Supply Chain Transparency","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1,2","second_sdg":"45,268","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,2,8,12,","number_of_sd_gs":"4","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a distributed network of local farms around the world.

This asset will be made available to the blockchain community and in doing so add value in many dimensions to our collective future.\n\nAsh Elements Values\n\nProtect the Environment\nSecure Mineral Rights\nCreate Asset Value \nBuild a Strategic REE stockpile for the US\n\nAsh Elements Vision\n\nAsh Elements is an Asset Back Token (ABT) that captures the value of rare earth minerals in coal ash in the form of mineral rights. Rare Earth Elements are referred to as vitamins for metals and electronics without which our high tech world ceases to exist. These mineral rights for premium coal ash basins are secured by a holding company through which mining or refining company can redeem ASH tokens Rare earth mineral rights to particular sites under contract. Each Ash Token is contractually tied to 1 metric ton of fly ash.\n\nRare Earth elements are a strategic imperative to the United States of America.  Many of these minerals have no substitutes. China has a virtual monopoly on Rare earth minerals and alternate supplies are needed to ensure that the world manufacturing base is not disrupted buy Rare earth mineral price fluctuations.  \n\nThe technology to extract these minerals from coal ash are being developed in research laboratories all over the world. Once these processes are matured and commercially viable coal ash will be in high demand. Those that have right to it likely will profit in this future world.  Ash Elements is a bridge to realize value of that future world today.\n\nIn the mean time while these technologies mature coal ash continues to be a controversial environmental problem and is considered a liability. The Ash Elements token addresses these issues by turning coal ash into an asset via the Etherium blockchain.  This makes money available for environmental clean up and preserves the asset for future use as a strategic minerals reserve.

By using social media, the power of the crowd, and secure digital transaction technology, Batan turbo-charges existing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThe batan offset is composed of a basket of allowances and offsets from the world’s main emissions trading and carbon credit schemes. The basket composition reflects the size of each scheme and is designed to represent a global emissions reduction unit.\n\nBy purchasing and owning batans, you are supporting all of the major emissions reductions schemes around the world.\n\nWhen you join Batan, you become part of a network of people who care about climate change and who are doing something about it. Individually there seems to be little we can do to have an impact on climate change, but collectively, we are powerful. As we each assume our responsibility and act, the drops in the ocean become waves which resonate around the globe.\n\nWhat is the basket?\nBatan is designed to be a standard global product representing the global emissions market. Individuals and companies can use a single product across all geographies. The basket uniquely includes both carbon offsets, which help fund new emissions reduction projects, and cancelled emissions allowances, which reduce emissions from existing sources. Some experts prefer offsets whereas others prefer allowances – our product includes both.\n\nHow much of an impact can we have?\nWe have dimensioned our technical platform to be able to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 100 billion tonnes. If we are able to achieve a fraction of this, we will collectively “move the dial” on global warming.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Save a Tonne of Carbon!","primary_headquarter_city":"London","primary_headquarter_country":"United Kingdom","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Europe","hq_subregion":"Western Europe","year_creation":"2015","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/batan_ltd?edit=true","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/batancarbon/?ref=bookmarks","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"Info@batan.io","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"","individual_contact_2_at_project":"","email_2":"","partner_tag":"x"},{"slug":"pokit-dok","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.463","ref":"628","project_name":"PokitDok","active":"Inactive","website":"https://pokitdok.com","categories":"Health","main_category":"Health","sub_categories":["Health"],"sub_categories_1":"Health","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"3","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",3,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a distributed network of transaction processors operating on both financial and clinical data across the healthcare industry","long_description":"PokitDok provides a secure software development platform for the business of health.

Every transaction will donate 0.1% of that transaction to the Charity Wallet, here’s an example: I’ve mined 1,000 Clean Water Coins and I request a manual payout from my pool. As a result of this transaction 1 coin will be donated to the Charity Wallet and the remaining 999 is sent to my wallet.\n\nTHE CHARITY WALLET\nAll donations will go to the Charity Wallet and from there will go to CharityWater.org. To prevent flooding our own market with donated coins we will set a recurring schedule to exchange to BTC, this will help to prevent large sums building up over extended periods of time and exchanging all at once. We will also offer the community the ability to purchase Clean Water Coins from the Charity Wallet. Pricing will be established from a market average and the amount of coins available will depend on total donations to the Charity Wallet. More details regarding this feature are soon to come!\n\nADDING VALUE TO CLEAN WATER COIN\nWe recognize that there are many factors that go into the valuation of a coin. Some of those things we can attempt to control and affect, but others rely on the community, exchanges, and the industry. So rather than only relying on trading and exchanges to dictate pricing, we’ve gone to great lengths to add value to holding and using Clean Water Coin.\n\n\"We designed Clean Water Coin to have a function that donates a small portion of every transaction.

However, charities provide very little insight into where the donation is going, and how much of it gets applied. Unfortunately, charity fraud is an ever-growing concern with 1 in 3 people in the U.S. alone expressing distrust of how their donation is used.\n\nAltruism, philanthropy and benevolence are all used to describe the fundamental desire in most people to have an impact and help others. Harnessing this basic inclination requires a strategy that weaves the individual, the employer, merchants, charitable organizations and fundraisers together in a new more efficient solution to address the rising tide of need in the world.\n\nGiga Giving has an ambitious and holistic vision that uses blockchain technology to provide a platform that revolutionizes charitable giving.\n\nGiga Giving is building a platform which will provide a new way to make donations, conduct charitable campaigns and fundraisers, all in a completely transparent and publicly accountable way; but more than that, it’s also a new way to connect people and their donations to those who need them with fewer transactions, less cost, and less complexity. Giga Giving is founded on the idea that charitable giving shouldn’t be opaque, or hard to understand. Our goal is to change how charities work around the world, by giving people complete insight into how their donation is used, and how it benefits others – while improving the efficiency of managing a charitable program through modern technology.\n\nThis platform will provide charitable organizations the necessary infrastructure to move into the future.\n\nWhy\nWith Blockchain technologies experiencing tremendous growth worldwide, there are many organizations that are trying to leverage this new concept in a way to help charities. The difference between Giga Giving and these other organizations, is that Giga Giving provides a start to finish platform to connect donors to recipients, with complete transparency, and accountability.\n\nWhile Blockchain provides a public and tamper resistant ledger of donations, Giga Giving takes it a step further and helps donors search for recipients that meet their criteria and performance expectations. We help businesses meet their goals for social responsibility by empowering employees to contribute to charitable organizations through employee based programs. We allow direct peer to peer donations and provide a process for emergency disaster relief. Giga Giving facilitates donations that remain local with support for intangible assets such as goods and services.\n\nWe enhance the donor experience by allowing prospective donors to search for recipients and charities based on validated information, transparency, and history of impact. Giga Giving makes it possible for individuals and businesses to select specific charities to donate to, or set a criteria and preferences for their contributions which may allow the system to automate selecting or recommending recipients based on need.\n\nDigital currency is a very elegant way to send money overseas or across traditional borders, making it a great way to donate while reducing transaction costs and fees. Many charitable organizations are working to leverage the Blockchain for cross- border donations. Giga Giving believes that redefining charitable giving requires a robust and forward thinking toolset to realize the full potential of a highly efficient, global, transparent, intelligent platform connecting donors to recipients.\n\nGiga Giving believes that the solution to addressing inefficient charities and fraud is to build a completely transparent system that is purpose built to deliver donations where intended, with minimal transaction costs. With modern Blockchain technologies, that is finally possible on a global scale.\n\nOne of the key developments of modern Blockchains is the ability to define Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts serve to create an immutable and publicly verifiable electronic contract, which lays out very specific rules for how donations are handled. For example, you can design a Smart Contract that designates a donation recipient, what currency they need, how much they need, and a timeline for fulfilment. Then individuals can contribute into the contract, and once it meets the criteria for fulfilment, the funds are disbursed – directly to the intended recipient(s). \n\nAnd if it takes too long to reach the goal, or the recipient fails due-diligence, the donations can easily be returned to the contributors.\nSmart Contracts are publicly viewable agreements, so anyone can review the contracts, and perform full diligence on them. They also make it easy to follow the progress of a donation to see who received it, and when. And yet another benefit of using Smart Contracts for a contribution is that they provide an electronic receipt for your donations, so if you need a record of your donations or just want to view your donation history, you can right from your smartphone or computer.\n\nGiga Giving also provides a place where companies can agree to provide goods to fulfil a donation contract. This allows local companies the chance to invest in their own community and reduces waste related to transport and conversions.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Charity on the Chain","primary_headquarter_city":"Alpharetta","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"John Goss, Managing Partner; Mark Phillips, Managing Partner; Jeremy McKee, Director of Engineering","organization_type":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/GigaGiving","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/gigagiving/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=649A-ZL0GLY","white_paper_url":"http://gigagiving.com/GigaGiving-Whitepaper.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@gigagiving.com"},{"slug":"alm-bank","":"","original_source_name":"unknown (probably: PB research)","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"Project died?

value as one, start-up out of University of Wisconsin Madison and Illinois Institute of Technology. The project got rebranded https://veriown.com/","long_description":"Wattcoin Labs is solving the global energy problems of access, efficient use, and carbon reduction by building a platform as a service where energy and its value can come together. We are a team of leading global experts and innovators in the areas of blockchain, cryptocurrency, fintech, microgrids, and utility systems. Our research, development , and commercialization activities are applied in the following three areas…\n \n Learn More:\n \n Wattcoin Labs, a startup out of University of Wisconsin Madison and Illinois Institute of Technology, aims to be the payment platform that drives renewable energy consumption and transfer.\n \n Using blockchain technology, they’ve created a digital currency where people can transact energy without a central bank, similar to Bitcoin. Their goal is to improve access to energy for people who aren’t on the grid, create rewards for energy efficiency, and allow users to trade carbon and carbon value at a microscale.\n \n “In ways that Bitcoin changed financial transactions, Wattcoin will change energy transactions,” said Wattcoin founder Ben Johanns, a sophomore at UW-Madison and a Naperville native. “It is the beginning of the ‘Energy Internet.’” \n \n IT IS THE BEGINNING OF THE ‘ENERGY INTERNET\n \n Their technology has a number of applications including setting up peer-to-peer energy transactions and renewable energy loyalty programs for utilities companies, but they’re starting out with payments for solar home systems in emerging markets, hoping to reduce dependency on kerosene and provide a payment solution for the unbanked.\n \n Wattcoin is currently developing the payment platform for Chicago energy company Veriown‘s forthcoming solar home system. Users purchase Wattcoin credits on a smart payment card from a local vendor (who completes the transaction on his or her smartphone), and place the card on a reader which converts the credits into energy that can power a light or smartphone charge.\n \n They’re aiming to address the question: “How can you transact for energy in the most rural places in the world?” said Johanns.\n \n He pointed out that kerosene (used by 1.3 billion people worldwide for light) causes both pollution and health problems. While renewable energy solution could provide a safer and cleaner energy option, the World Bank reports less than half of adults in South Asia and about a third of adults in sub-Saharan Africa have bank accounts, which makes paying for renewable energy difficult. Johanns believes Wattcoin can bridge that gap.\n \n Veriown demoed the solar home system with Wattcoin tech at the Energy Revolution Conference in Sierra Leone last spring, which led to 9,000 pre-orders (Veriown then paid for further commercialization and development of Wattcoin tech). They’re rolling out 45,000 units across three states in India (Uttar Pradesh, Gujurat, and Tamil Nadu) by late Q2 of this year, and are planning for a larger roll out by the end of the year.\n \n IN WAYS THAT BITCOIN CHANGED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, WATTCOIN WILL CHANGE ENERGY TRANSACTIONS\n \n Johanns previously worked as an intern at Veriown (his father, Steve Johanns, is the CEO) and has been Bitcoin mining since he was in middle school. Wattcoin team members also include recent Illinois Tech electrical engineering grad Jimmy Shah, current Illinois Tech electrical engineering graduate student Farsh Umrigar, UW-Madison electrical engineering sophomore Tyler Barker, and recent University of Pennsylvania grad Kristopher Jenk. Wattcoin will compete for $50,000 in the upcoming CleantechUP competition, held by the Clean Energy Trust and Department of Energy.\n \n As they move forward, Johanns sees Wattcoin as a platform-as-a-service company that makes money through licensing and transaction fees as they continue to roll out solutions. Next up, they’re working on a prototype of a carbon credit exchange on the blockchain.\n \n The energy industry needs a more “nimble” payment infrastructure, some have said, as independent wind and solar farms feed into the grid. Other startups besides Wattcoin are developing blockchain technology for the energy industry, such as New York-based LO3 Energy.\n \n “The reason blockchain is so transformative and why Wattcoin is using it is because the blockchain creates a great platform to move value across a global network without an intermediary or ‘middleman,'” explained Johanns. “In the case of energy you can create transactions for both [kilowatts] of energy as well as the carbon value of the energy. [This] allows for some disruptive business models where people can transact energy and carbon credits, or carbon offset credits, between themselves without going through middleman or utility.”","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"Energy Enabled","primary_headquarter_city":"Chicago","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Ben Johanns, Co-Founder; Steve Johanns, Co-Founder","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/wattcoin","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/Wattcoin","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LRHEoIVWSo","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"https://www.americaninno.com/chicago/wattcoin-is-bringing-blockchain-technology-to-the-energy-industry/","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@wattcoin.com"},{"slug":"land-lay-by","":"","original_source_name":"added / claimed website","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.483","ref":"676","project_name":"Land LayBy","active":"Active","website":"https://hrbe.io/","categories":"Finance & Insurance,Government & Democracy,Identity & Ownership,Identity & Ownership","main_category":"Identity & Ownership","sub_categories":["Land & Titling","Digital Identity","eGovernment & Public Services"],"sub_categories_1":"Land & Titling","sub_categories_2":"Digital Identity","sub_categories_3":"eGovernment & Public Services","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"9","second_sdg":"9, 16","third_sdg":"9, 16","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",9,9,16,9,16,","number_of_sd_gs":"5","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a trusted shared distributed ledger for recording land buying and selling transactions that can never be altered, corrupted, forged or replicated in error","long_description":"Leveraging on the blockchain technology, Land LayBy is building Land LayBy Listing; a trusted shared distributed ledger for recording land buying and selling transactions that can never be altered, corrupted, forged or replicated in error.\n \n Land buyers all over the world face land acquisition challenges from the lack of reliable information about the land they are interested in acquiring.

And, modules around the hub can be provided with access to that energy and water for vertical farming, greenhouse growth, rainwater processing, water purification, and algae farming.\n \n The WATERIG hubs and modules could be a valuable resource to the local community for providing a truly decentralized and sustainable water and food supply. \n \n It’s flexible for easy scaling: each community can plug the different modules they need into the hub at their own pace.\n \n But the benefits of the system don’t just redound to the local community. Each WATERIG hub will contribute to two blockchains:\n \n The first blockchain will track the ownership of each hub, enabling community-level crowdfunding and micro-ownership without a central authority. \n \n The second blockchain will collect data on water, food production, and usage transactions by its members. This has the potential to grow an economy around these WATERIG hubs.\n \n Both blockchains will be publically searchable with no interference or manipulation by companies or governments. This can increase efficiency, create jobs, and ultimately provide food and water to local communities.\n \n WATERIG is currently in the protytping stage as they are building a pilot in Hong Kong with a major vertical farming site and in Dongguan with a manufacturing plant.

Eventually, after experience and education, the farmer can sell his crop forward or hedge his prices with futures.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"Mauritius","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Africa","hq_subregion":"Eastern Africa","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"Hirander Misra  Co-Chairman, CEO & Founder","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/FinComEco","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/fincomeco/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://youtu.be/Tigf1fy3Lcc","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Gmex","servicing_area":"Africa","servicing_region":"Africa","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@fincomeco.com"},{"slug":"bit-mari-smart-farm-contracts","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Ronald","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.375","ref":"749","project_name":"BitMari Smart Farm Contracts","active":"inactive","website":"http://www.bitmari.com/","categories":"Agriculture & Food","main_category":"Agriculture & Food","sub_categories":["Farming"],"sub_categories_1":"Farming","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"1,2","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",1,2,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a platform to bring fairness, transparency and accountability in contract farming projects.Connecting sponsors with Africa’s amazing farmers in a peer to peer relationship; sharing financial, social and professional capital","long_description":"","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"Zimbabwe","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Africa","hq_subregion":"Eastern Africa","year_creation":"","founder_names":"","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"http://www.bitmari.com/static/assets/all/images/farmers/BitMariSmartFarmContractsWhitepaper.pdf","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"Africa","servicing_region":"Africa","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"info@bitmari.com"},{"slug":"ubricoin","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.455","ref":"630","project_name":"Ubricoin","active":"Inactive","website":"https://ubricoin.com/","categories":"Health","main_category":"Health","sub_categories":["Health"],"sub_categories_1":"Health","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"3","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",3,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a partnership between the Ustawi Biomedical Research Innovation and Industrial Centers of Africa, building the most prominent high-tech research and development centers in Africa","long_description":"Ubricoin is a blockchain Technology for Global Health Ensuring Universal health access for you and your loved ones.\n\nUbricoin will help create a system for solving the three fundamental problems in healthcare: lack of access to health services, poor quality of health services and high cost of health services.

Rather it is a profit-for-purpose business with a smart model and ambition to build and launch a blockchain for social impact platform.\nAs the digital space matures there is increasing demand for more authentic and ethical projects. And projects with asset backing.\nCharitex is one response to this call.\nIt is a blockchain project – developed in Australia – to deliver positive social impact.\nICO’s may continue but Charitex presents the first-ever ECO™ (Ethical Coin Offering) with its ECO launch planned for late July 2018.\n\nDistribution, trust, equity and peer-to-peer accountability is at the heart of blockchain.\nThis is a logical technology to deploy in order to address issues of social and environmental need.\nA token economy can be designed to give attention to commercial imperatives, as well as, enable the building of positive social impact and value.\nCharitex will leverage blockchain, integrate other tech and software plus engage a community to introduce a new approach to creating social impact.\nThe system side-steps the ongoing need for donations, instead will conduct a funding event offering positions in the Charitex Social Impact Fund with an associated Charitex token.\n• Once established the business will put funds to work to create yield\n• The business will evolve and generate ongoing revenue via multiple revenue streams\n• It will link with and grow an engaged Community using the utility token (ERC20) for voting and social impact project nominations\n• Charitex has a plan to create an integrated platform for management and P2P funding of social impact projects\n• The Charitex platform will be offered fort to Friends of Charitex: when proven it will then be promoted to a broader market which includes NFPs and NGOs as well as for CSR

Berkeley plans to use blockchain, a digital technology that creates a ledger of economic transactions, to create bonds for funding affordable housing projects.\n\n“Neighborly is building a crypto-enabled technology stack that will offer a new, customizable structure to finance critical community projects in the form of a new class of cryptoassets: cryptobonds,” said Kiran Jain, Neighborly’s chief operating officer, in an email.\n\nBBI entails the creation of a municipal bond using blockchain technology. This involves an “initial community offering,” analogous to the initial coin offering used to crowdfund cryptocurrency, which allows Berkeley to take control of fundraising, according to Jain.\n\nCommunity members can purchase digital tokens backed by municipal bonds. If the plan succeeds, Berkeley will be the first city to issue cryptocurrency.\n\n“Issuers like Berkeley could use cryptobonds to finance affordable housing and the critical social services that Berkeley needs to address its growing homelessness population while meeting the needs of the socially-minded Berkeley investor,” Jain said in an email.\n\nBerkeley has about 1,000 homeless people and increasingly high rents. Arreguín and Bartlett have both named homelessness as a key issue in their platforms.\n\n“We’re not going to accept that there’s no money, we’re going to create it,” Bartlett said. “Blockchain technology is the future of public finance and human economic interactions.”\n\nCryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, are based off blockchain technology. Bitcoin has garnered recent attention for its large fluctuations in value, rising from $1,000 to $19,000 and back down to $8,000 since January 2017. This has brought its reliability into question, which Bartlett refutes.\n\n“Because it’s not a coin, it’s a bond, there will be no fluctuation in price,” Bartlett said. “The blockchain platform is secure.”\n\nThe project will be privately funded, with guidance from city officials. Neighborly is underwriting this project,  according to Bartlett.\n\n“We feel that since this new economy is emerging, Berkeley should shape it,” Bartlett said. “We have the human ethic to make sure the human economy is just and results in shared prosperity.”","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"Berkeley","primary_headquarter_country":"United States","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"North America","hq_subregion":"North America","year_creation":"2018","founder_names":"","organization_type":"Public-Private-Partnership","twitter_url":"","facebook_url":"","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"","white_paper_url":"","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"Neighborly","servicing_area":"United States","servicing_region":"North America","subregions":"North America","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"editor@dailycal.org","individual_contact_1_at_project":"","email_1":"James Dorn","individual_contact_2_at_project":"jdorn@dailycal.org","email_2":"Olivia Jerram"},{"slug":"sunverge-alectra-utilities","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.383","ref":"587","project_name":"Sunverge & Alectra Utilities","active":"Inactive","website":"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/alectra-expands-business-relationship-with-sunverge-energy-300717651.html","categories":"Energy","main_category":"Energy","sub_categories":["Energy"],"sub_categories_1":"Energy","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"7, 13","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",7,13,","number_of_sd_gs":"2","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a new energy program for Net Zero Energy Emissions and Blockchain to Connect with Sunverge Dynamic Virtual Power Plant","long_description":"Alectra Utilities and Sunverge are expanding their business relationship with the deployment of two new programs: the Net Zero Energy Emissions (NZEE) program and a distribution level ancillary services market platform based on blockchain. These programs are broadening the scope of Alectra's use of the Sunverge Dynamic Virtual Power Plant (VPP) platform and are part of Alectra's ongoing strategic initiatives in decentralizing the grid through distributed energy resources and value creation through new services.\n\nThe goal of the NZEE program is to optimize the use of electric and gas resources to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and move towards NZEE. The NZEE program consists of hybrid-heated homes in the community with Sunverge's DER platform controlling, managing and optimizing electric demand management (with solar PV + storage) and thermal load control to automatically and continuously optimize between electricity and natural gas for thermal energy needs based on the bulk power grid's GHG emissions. The Sunverge Dynamic VPP platform will receive real-time grid supply emissions data to determine optimal operation between gas and electricity, and coordinate across solar PV, energy storage, micro-combined heat and power (mCHP) with integrated air source heat pump, EV charger, thermostat and hot water heater controllers in order to minimize greenhouse gas emissions on an aggregated community wide VPP basis.\n\nAlectra Utilities also selected Sunverge to be one of the first technology vendors to integrate with their upcoming Blockchain-enabled transactive energy platform. The platform, designed and implemented by Alectra, will facilitate contracting, compliance, and settlement of distribution level market services. The objective is to validate how blockchain technology can be leveraged to support the energy sector by tracking and assigning attributes and value to renewable energy generation that can be exchanged among parties with minimal cost. The Sunverge VPP platform will control residential solar PV, energy storage and EV chargers for localized demand response events, GHG reduction programs, and EV load shifting programs and interface with the Blockchain platform to provide the requisite ledger transactions for settlement. All aspects of market participation – availability, response time, duration – will be measured and instantly verified on the blockchain.\n\n\"Our goal is to leverage decentralization in many forms to responsibly create greater value and new services for our customers and community,\" said Vikram Singh, Director of Advanced Planning at Alectra Utilities. \"Our initial investments in DERs and VPP technology have proven it works and our choice of Sunverge has enabled us to continue our innovation.\"\n\n\"Alectra is very creative and forward thinking in their approach to leveraging our platform,\" said Martin Milani, CEO of Sunverge. \"Our business relationship is leading the way to combining technology with new business strategies and services that will better serve the interests of the utility, the community, and the market as a whole.\"\n\nAbout Alectra Utilities Corporation\n\nAlectra Utilities Corporation serves approximately one million customers across an 1,800 square kilometre service territory and 15 communities including Alliston, Aurora, Barrie, Beeton, Bradford, Brampton, Hamilton, Markham, Mississauga, Penetanguishene, Richmond Hill, St. Catharines, Thornton, Tottenham and Vaughan. It is part of the Alectra family of companies, which also includes Alectra Inc. and Alectra Energy Solutions Inc.\n\nAbout Sunverge Energy\n\nSunverge Energy provides the leading open, dynamic platform for Virtual Power Plants (VPP) with near real-time control, orchestration and aggregation of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources (DERs). The Sunverge platform provides co-optimization of services on both sides of the meter, helping customers have access to backup power, reduce their energy bill and maximize the use of their renewable energy while helping utilities to efficiently and proactively manage DERs on the distribution grid, lower operational costs, increase feeder resiliency and meet their renewable energy and carbon reduction goals.

Farmers are unable to access affordable credit, insurance, high quality inputs, affordable logistics providers, and competitive markets. These inefficiencies lead to high rates of farmer poverty.  \n\nRicult aims to fix the agriculture value chain through a mobile platform. By improving the value chain, we are enabling farmers to pull themselves out of poverty while tapping a multi-billion dollar market. We launched our pilot in Pakistan in February 2016 and currently have over 3,600 farmers accessing our platform.\n\nRicult comes from the middle syllables of the word 'Agriculture'. In keeping with this phonetic tradition, Ricult aims to become integral to the agriculture of tomorrow. The solution to global problems like food shortage, malnourishment, poverty, rural unemployment need to start with smallholder farmers. We feel the world is ready for farming to be revolutionized and become more inclusive and empowering for the very people who form the backbone of this industry. This goal defines the very core of what we are all about. We are not a charity; We are an empowering community transformation. This is the basis for a brighter future, built on hand-ups, not handouts.\n\n\"We are social impact driven. Our goal is measured by the farmer’s income increase. We were able to increase their income by up to 50%. We want to keep doubling their income through technology to enable their families to afford health care, a better education and enrich their lives with a positive impact to the wider agriculture

(Project seems inactive or has been aborted)","long_description":"There are big challenges 1.5 Billion Muslims all around the world are facing as of today. Block chain technology will be the new future no doubt. Unfortunately Muslim society is following this revolution relatively slow and late. However HALAL Coin project aims to ease Muslims to keep up with the revolution. The main idea is to facilitate the mass adoption of HALAL Coin in long term. This will economically empower individuals since the maximum amount in circulation is fixed unlike fiat currencies. Easier trading and storage possibilities compared to gold. Aims to strengthen the commerce ties among Muslims internationally by offering a trustless commerce platform and another aim is to create a strong community and governance to become the leading force and leading voice of all Muslims which is the only way to stop expansion of ISIS propaganda.\n\nWhy HALAL Coin ??\nFirst of all, as the name already implies, earnings for inverting in HALAL Coin is a ‘HALAL’ earning according to Islam since it is not ‘riba’ (interest) earning.?\n\nEconomic Reasons\nBlock chain technology is the safest way of storing and transferring assets. And it is getting understood that crypto economy is the future. It is way more superior in safety and growth aspects compared to precious metals and financial derivatives. However Muslim community has been relatively late and slow to adopt this technology.\n\nTraditional investments methods like gold and fiat currencies are set to vanish gradually. Especially gold which is a very common investment among Muslims is set to lose its value very soon since cryptoassets are much more advantageous in many aspects.  Investing in Bitcoin or other cryptoassets would make rich only the early adopters of Bitcoin and other altcoins. It is the time to deploy an option for 1.5 Billion Muslims which comes from Muslims and for Muslims.\n\nHALAL Coin is the first real opportunity for Muslims to improve the economic power of Muslims since it is developed by Muslims and supported by Muslims and non-Muslim fellows.\nWe are at the edge of a new and stronger economic crisis since no lessons are learnt from the last one. Instead Central Banks multiplied the amount of fiat currencies in the circulation which temporarily delayed a big correction and created an even bigger bubble which is due to explode very soon. This time it is called ‘Everything Bubble’ and this time stock market, real estate market and bonds market bubbles are set to explode all together. Cryptocurrencies and precious metals have been proven safe haven in these circumstances.\n\nHALAL Coin  differs from other cryptocurrencies in a particular way. Let me explain how. All other cryptoassets are targeting cryptofuns all around the world predominantly which is already very saturated and there is not much room to grow. HALAL Coin however chooses a different path to grow, adoption of specific masses. Instead of aiming a global acceptance from the beginning which is very complicated and challenging for a new coin, HALAL Coin aims to have a local & society specific target mass which has stronger religious, cultural, economic and commercial connections already. Once this aim is achieved the global admittance will be inevitable eventually.\n\nIdeological reasons\nAlthough Islam is the religion of peace, charity and brotherhood, it is perceived quite negatively by western society especially after ISIS terrorism.  We real Muslims don’t consider them as Muslim since their actions are completely opposite to Islamic fundamentals, however those bunch of sinners are influencing the image of Islam more than the rest of 1,5 billion Muslims. ISIS has strong economic and human resources and recruiting especially young and fool Muslims in deep web and in local mosques. There should be something to be done by our huge Muslim anti ISIS community to stop ISIS poisoning our children.\nThe aim of HALAL Coin is to create a community and economic resources to establish and diffuse a strong anti ISIS propaganda on all web platforms and mosques and organizing events to inform Muslims about the ISIS religion scam.\nAnother common problem of Muslim nations is the anti-democratic puppet governments. Most Muslim nations condemned to live with it. I had personally foreseen that Arab spring was coming years before it started. Because internet and user friendly social media were being adopted by masses. A new Arab spring is on the road now because crypto revolution is coming. However this time it will be softer but more efficient. Because dictatorships will realize that they have to convince their citizens instead of oppressing. There will be no other way to survive for them. Cause if citizens lose their trust on government they will switch to crypto assets and this will weaken the government economically so that the fiat money they print will be useless to pay salaries of police and armed forces.\n\nHow?\nAs HALAL Coin project team and fastly growing HALAL Coin community will move together to decide where the resources should be allocated. This will be achieved by a regularly organized polls and feedbacks from HALAL Coin community.?\n\nMarketing \nHALAL Coins are neither sold nor mined. HALAL Coins are earned as bounties , (more info https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2026521.0)  Some of the earned HALALs are sold at Waves DEX  by its holder.  Buying HALALs at Waves DEX Since it is not sold in an ICO or similar event only given as bounties makes HALAL Coin strong marketing  and fairly, merit base distributed This unique way of introduction of HALAL Coin  will bring  mass adoption of HALAL Coin by Muslims at first place. This includes intensive social media activity, advertisements and public events.  Admisson to several exchange platforms. (Bittrex, Tidex, Yobit, crptopia,livecoin etc.)  This aggressive marketing will be ongoing continuously. So the investors can see the effect of their contribution directly.??\nAt second stage, marketing will be expanded in order to reach masses which have never heard of even Bitcoin. At this stage the number of participating merchants and number of physical ATM s will be increased rapidly.\nAfter certain acceptance is reached within certain countries, commerce chambers, financial and governmental institutions will be poked continuously in order to convince them to use HALAL Coin and/or encourage people to use it.\n\nTechnology development\nAfter we successfully implement a separate Block-Chain (Intentionally POS ). At the moment we have been evaluating several existing technologies closely and performing tests (Waves , Ethereum, NEO, Next, Omni, Counterparty. etc ) We have successfully forked and tested so far several block chains. However new technologies are on the way like tangle, graphene and delegated POS among others. We want to make sure that the technology we fork and develop to be at least one of best for the time being and for the near future. Should be userfriendly, light, scalable, stabile and proven. We are very ambitious to deploy Token creation tool and a decentralized exchange platform on top of this block chain before the boom of Islamic capital adoption. \n\nEducation & Anti ISIS propaganda\nWe will incentivize Muslim bloggers, youtubers, twitterers etc. for their contribution to widespread the idea behind the HALAL Coin and anti ISIS propaganda. There will be no free giveaway. We will work closely with our community to incentivize those individuals.\nFurthermore, nonprofit educational organizations, sports organizations and public events like World Islamic Economic Forum will be sponsored and separate events will be held for both marketing and ideological reasons.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"","primary_headquarter_country":"","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"#N/A","hq_subregion":"#N/A","year_creation":"2017","founder_names":"","organization_type":"","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/HALAL_Coin"},{"slug":"health-combix","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.397","ref":"637","project_name":"HealthCombix","active":"Inactive","website":"https://www.hcxi.co/","categories":"Health","main_category":"Health","sub_categories":["Health"],"sub_categories_1":"Health","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"3","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",3,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a token-based healthcare payment and risk management network enabling payments, data asset monetization and risk adjustment - consumers have control of their data for research, precision health, clinical trials, payment and disease intervention.

NCDs cause 2 out of 3 deaths worldwide. The 2015 Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) Global Survey showed that 1 in 4 Indians face the risk of death from an NCD before they hit the age of 70. In addition to causing premature deaths, NCDs also impede the quality of life of people. NCDs are a threat not only to human health, but also to economic development and growth. NCDs account for an annual loss of 5-10% of GDP in India, leading to a crippling effect on the individual and the economy.\n\nCurrent health care systems, both in the public and private sectors, are heavily oriented towards reactive care and episodic treatment. There is less emphasis on preventive, primary and continuous care that is required to manage long term clinical and behavioral modifications necessary to manage chronic conditions and reduce long term health costs for individuals and health systems. NanoHealth has taken on this challenge of building a solution to tackle NCDs at scale.\n\nOur trained health coaches, network of highly recognized doctors, and an integrated technology solution provide proactive and continuous care. We empower individuals, communities and governments to fight against the growing challenges of chronic diseases.","tags_keywords":"","business_tagline":"","primary_headquarter_city":"Hyderabad","primary_headquarter_country":"India","secondary_headquarter_city":"","secondary_headquarter_country":"","hq_region":"Asia","hq_subregion":"Southern Asia","year_creation":"2014","founder_names":"Manish Ranjan, CEO & Co-Founder","organization_type":"start-up","twitter_url":"https://twitter.com/NanoHealth1","facebook_url":"https://www.facebook.com/NanoHealth.in/","linkedin_url":"","discord_url":"","video_url":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ5_SJdc3d7yTueH8rVBAOw/feed","white_paper_url":"https://www.nhct.io/#download-link","coin_market_cap_url":"","github_url":"","other_links":"","logo_url":"","token_ticker":"NHCT","blockchain_type":"","blockchain_technology":"","coinmarketcap_url":"","github_link":"","sponsors_partners":"","servicing_area":"","servicing_region":"","subregions":"","global_north_south":"","pb_personal_contact":"","project_official_email":"contact@nanohealth.in"},{"slug":"open-health-network","":"","original_source_name":"PB contributor (add or edit): : Lucas","original_source_organization":"Positiveblockchain","verification_status":"","verified_by":"","verified_on":"","comment":"0.364","ref":"782","project_name":"Open Health Network","active":"Active","website":"https://www.openhealth.cc/","categories":"Health","main_category":"Health","sub_categories":["Patient data"],"sub_categories_1":"Patient data","sub_categories_2":"","sub_categories_3":"","sub_categories_4":"","first_sdg":"3","second_sdg":"","third_sdg":"","fourth_sdg":"","sdg_occurences":",3,","number_of_sd_gs":"1","description_short_value_proposition_in_a_tweet":"a blockchain platform to help consumers control and monetize their medical data.

These goods are also assigned physical attributes such as colors and qualities. This makes it easy to monitor the condition of goods and ensure that any harm done is traced to a particular participant, and that goods whose quality has been compromised can be traced and recalled.

Why blockchain?\n This technology is good if used correctly.\n It will allow:\n - secure storage of genetic data\n - exchange\n - getting profit from individuals\n - new genomic based services\n - transparency of the requests\n - rating system\n - payment system\n All that will allow you to create ecosystem of genomic information exchange.\n \n The Zenome solution is unique, because it allows different types of data to be stored using appropriate technologies. So genomic data is stored securely divided by small parts on the distributed network. Transaction data and rating system lives on the ethereum blockchain. All calculations can be done on nodes, managed by private blockchain. The scheme is flexible enough for all those activities . For example now there are blockchain based solutions for data storage and calculations so the Zenome team doesn’s exclude future partnership with other startups in that
