Eliminating the need for a middleman and numerous corporate layers, 180 plans to allocate 80% or more of donated funds directly to beneficiaries.\n\nUsing the latest development in global blockchain networks, i.e. Stellar, results in inexpensive global payment options & the ability for external parties such as governments or private donors to easily audit the system. Transactions through the 180-operational chain will be visible, traceable, immutable, permanent and therefore, auditable. This makes 180 one of the first truly transparent aid and development organization in the world.\n\n180 plans to use Stellar Blockchain to manage world-wide donations and project payments scalable to millions of people in need of work and assistance, resulting in completed transactions for a fraction of traditional transactions costs in just a matter of seconds",
