The clock is ticking.
Currently, atmospheric CO2 levels are at ~405–410 parts per million (ppm). Levels above 450 ppm risk runaway feedback loops—including more warming—that will be difficult to stop.

We can do this.
CO2 can be removed from the atmosphere by ecological and/or industrial means. It can be sequestered in trees, kelp, soil, minerals, and even manufactured products like plastics and timber.

A new price on carbon.
Our new currency is backed by carbon removal. Every token is worth 1 ton of CO2 removal and will finance a new economy of restoration.

Frequently Asked Questions
What are the different types of carbon removal?
There are many ways to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. They fall into three main categories: ecological, industrial, and hybrid. 

Ecological carbon removal can be achieved through better management and restoration of ecosystems on land and in the ocean.

Reforestation is the establishment of forests or stands of trees where there previously was no recent forest cover. Carbon dioxide is captured by photosynthesis and is stored in the biomass of the forest. 
Blue Carbon refers to carbon captured by the world’s oceans and coastal ecosystems. The carbon is captured by marine life, and ends up being stored as biomass or in sediments. Algae, kelp, mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrasses can all sequester carbon. Many animals help drive these processes, including sea otters, tiger sharks, turtles, and sperm whales.
Soil Carbon Storage refers to techniques that can increase the organic and inorganic matter stored soils on farms and other managed lands. 
Industrial carbon removal refers to engineered solutions that do not depend on ecological processes. 

Direct air capture with mineral geologic sequestration uses machines to extract and concentrate carbon dioxide to store in mineral carbonates with no economic value. 
Direct air capture into products uses machines to extract and concentrate carbon dioxide into products ranging from concrete, polymers, graphene, and other stable materials containing carbon molecules formerly in the air. 
Hybrid carbon removal solutions combine ecological and industrial processes. 

Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) relies on biomass to remove carbon dioxide, generate energy at a power plant, and produce gaseous emissions which can be captured and stored underground. 
Biochar also relies on biomass to remove carbon dioxide and generate energy, but has a process that starves the fuel of oxygen, thereby leaving behind a residue that when spread over soil creates a negative emission. 
Biosequestration in materials is any approach that leverages biology to create a carbon sink in products—ranging from carpets to clothes to building materials. 
Enhanced weathering covers a number of geologic processes that occur on land or in ocean where certain minerals react with carbon dioxide and turn it into a solid, sequestered form.
 
What is Carbon Removal?
Carbon removal refers to any ecological or industrial approach that can take carbon dioxide out of atmospheric or oceanic circulation beyond what would have occurred without humans. Right now, carbon removal approaches have different costs, degrees of maturity, measurement needs, permanence, energy consumption/production, and additional uncertainties. But they are all the same in their growing potential as ways to capture and store carbon dioxide in order to help reverse climate change.

Why do we need Carbon Removal to stop climate change?
Since the industrial revolution, mankind has burned fossil fuels to produce energy which release greenhouse gases. In spite of long understanding the clear linkage between excess greenhouse gases (predominantly carbon dioxide) in the atmosphere and oceans and global climate change, humans have been unable to stop emitting. While reducing and replacing carbon emissions are key components to slowing down the flow of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for hundreds of years—warming the planet—the only way to stop the most severe effects of climate change is by balancing the total stock of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This can only be achieved through carbon removal.

Why blockchain for carbon removal?
The blockchain allows for a number of new opportunities to establish a market for carbon removal. Blockchain technologies allow us to issue a token, NORI, which sets one uniform price on removing carbon dioxide. Because a carbon removal credit can only be used once, and is immediately retired, our blockchain system avoids double counting, which occurs in the design of all other traditional carbon offset schemes. Furthermore, using a blockchain solution allows for complete transparency to the new type of carbon removal asset. Blockchain allows for substantially lower verification costs through automation and removing the many middle men involved in traditional carbon removal transactions. Lastly, through using a blockchain token as a medium of exchange, this solution removes the requirement for project sellers and buyers to find a counterparty, allowing all parties to participate in a fungible market.

How does the token relate to carbon removal?
1 Nori token allows for the purchase of a carbon removal credit (CRC). Think of it like a gift card that allows you to pay for carbon removal. One Nori token pays for one CRC. The Nori token can be purchased at any time and when it is spent in the Nori platform will immediately transfer ownership of a carbon removal credit to the buyer.

Who can use the Nori platform?
While anyone can purchase a Carbon Removal credit with a Nori token, we’ve identified a few important categories to get started:

Individuals who are looking for direct ways combat climate change
Cryptocurrency enthusiasts
Climate change activists
Businesses with a sustainability vision and carbon removal mandate
How do you generate carbon removal credits?
Whenever a seller performs a carbon removal action, we first verify that the carbon dioxide has actually been removed from the atmosphere and stored. The seller either uploads data manually, or the removal data is automatically reported into the Nori platform. This generates the creation of a new Carbon Removal Credit smart contract that is now available for purchase by a buyer.

How is Nori different from other voluntary carbon offset registries?
We only accept carbon removal projects. Reductions in emissions are not good enough.
Nori abstracts the exchange of CRC for Nori tokens by selling CRCs to buyers in a First In First Out (FIFO) order as they’re entered into the marketplace. We are commoditizing CO2.
Nori reduces the overhead costs for CRC providers by as much as 50% through the use of automated sensors and Internet of Things devices to measure how much CO2 was removed.
By accounting for the ownership of the CRCs on the blockchain, Nori eliminates the double-counting problem that has plagued past attempts at creating healthy carbon offsets markets.
Nori is establishing the framework for carbon accounting methodologies that are transparent, iterative, and with an open-source software perspective.

","Circles is a proposal for an electronic cryptocurrency with the aim to create, distribute and maintain Universal Basic Income. It is based on individualised currencies and a social graph of trust between these currencies. When new users join Circles, their personal cryptocurrency is created on a smart contract-enabled blockchain. This currency is then regularly minted and added to their account, forming the basis of Circles' UBI properties. The money becomes valuable only if the account owner connects to other accounts, and agrees to trust their personal currencies, treating them as identical to any other Circles currencies that they hold. These trust relationships form circles, fostering local networks and mutual economic cooperation. Through the use of blockchain technology, we expect Circles to be both resilient and globally accessible, which may be the key catalyst to make a Universal Basic Income achievable within the near future.

Credit-Based
In traditional debt-based currencies one sells goods, borrows money, or invests working power to receive money. With Circles, one receives money unconditionally to engage with their community, creating value through offering goods or services.

Decentralized
A worldwide basic income is something so powerful that no single entity should have control over the money or its recipients. Using blockchain technology, Circles will be independent of any central issuing authority or institution.

Resilient
Circles will run on the blockchain, a secure, decentralised, and autonomously managed database. Since the system's money emerges from a network of peer-to-peer relationships, it is possible to maintain stability on a local level, regardless of how things go at the national or global scale.

Fostering Cooperation
Circles promotes cooperation and economic interaction by creating local trade networks. The more connected community members are to each other, the more valuable their network becomes.

Hoarding Resistant
Circles has an inbuilt inflation target of 5% per annum to discourage hoarding. This also increases the velocity of money in circulation, creating more opportunities for exchange and economic activity.

Seigniorage
Seigniorage refers to the profit made from the difference between the production costs and the value of money. As Circles is a credit-based currency that costs almost nothing to create, you will retain almost all of this value as first spender.",,Basic Income on the Blockchain,Berlin,Germany,,,Europe,Central Europe,2015,Ed Murphy; Ronit Kory; Martin Köppelmann; Harriet von Froreich; Anne Walther; Karenina Schröder,start-up,https://twitter.com/CirclesUBI,https://business.facebook.com/CirclesUBI/?ref=py_c,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKsQ-kERiH0,https://github.com/CirclesUBI/docs/blob/master/Circles.md,,,https://opencollective.com/circles,,,Public,"Ethereum, Gnosis chain",,https://github.com/CirclesUBI,,Global,Global,Global,,"Ronald knows Sarah from the Berlin team, she knows about relaunch and happy to claim","info@joincircles.net

Project Owners retain data control and ownership rights related to their version of RAZ, while customizing impact metrics, access and publication settings

Actions and results are recorded while unfolding, as a digital “time capsule”on the Tezos blockchain 

Awareness-raising and support for our project was initiated by the Ocean DAO through grant funding in August and October 2021, and is being continued by grant and marketing support from the Tezos Foundation, fundraising with Sigma World in Malta, as well as an integration partnership with SupraOracles. 

We are finalizing a city-wide pilot project with the Jerusalem Municipality. http://jerusalemmunicipality.flywheelsites.com 

That will open the door for cities worldwide to utilize RAZ to engage their stakeholders, track funding allocation, verify, measure and manage project impact. 

Our second pilot is with the Daniel Cates Foundation https://razimpactmvp.flywheelsites.com to track data related to childhood education outcomes across the charitable projects the Foundation supports. The pilot will position RAZ as an effective solution for grant-makers and donors to track integrated impact and financial performance.

Starting from February 2022, we are establishing the headquarters of RAZ in Ireland

This will allow us to align with EU regulations on Anti Money Laundering and Financial Securities Trading ahead of our ICO, which we intend to launch in full regulatory compliance. 

Our platform will issue Decentralized Identifiers to pre-screened individual investors, and therefore provide a secure mechanism for impact investing in cryptocurrency. Through our transparent process, we intend to draw mainstream sustainability, impact and ESG investors towards Decentralized Finance. 

Our multi-stakeholder approach will allow us to bring together funders

Partnering with governments, NGOs and social enterprises, it provides  users with information, inspiration, and access to improve their health and wellbeing. 

Using Stellar’s open-source protocol, Praekelt is working on a mobile wallet that allows people to save cash or airtime using Vumi, their messaging platform—think Whatsapp, but open source and designed for the developing world, with a focus on improving the economic security of girls in South Africa.

Why girls?

In the developing world, only 37% of women have bank accounts. Research from Women’s World Banking has shown that poor women are inherent savers, putting away 10-15% of their earnings for emergencies. Due to a lack of financial services, however, they’re forced to save in unreliable and sometimes expensive ways—women often hide cash in their homes, where it isn’t secure, or buy livestock, which can become ill or die.

We believe that low-cost and reliable methods for savings could have an enormous impact on women, as well as on their families and communities.

Vumi already powers South Africa’s national maternal healthcare program, MomConnect, which sends expectant mothers prenatal health information over the course of their pregnancies. After a successful launch in South Africa last year, Praekelt is introducing the service in Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country. Since its founding, Praekelt’s programs have reached over 50 million people across 15 countries in sub-Saharan Africa.",,Promoting Economic Security for Girls in South Africa,Johannesburg,South Africa,,,Africa,Southern Africa,2015,,start-up,https://twitter.com/praekeltorg,https://www.facebook.com/praekeltorg,,,,,,,"https://www.stellar.org/blog/investing-in-the-future-with-vumi/

Our mission is to expand financial access and literacy worldwide.

When individuals have access to financial services and the confidence that those services are working in their best interest, those individuals can independently improve their lives. Yet the current financial system is too costly and complicated, leaving millions of people on the sidelines.

Just as the internet allowed anyone to send an email or create a blog, Stellar’s common financial platform now allows you to easily send, save, and receive money, without large fees or hassle.

LUMENS
Lumens are the native asset of the Stellar network.
Native means that lumens are built into the network. Asset is how the network refers to an item of value that is stored on the ledger.
One lumen is a unit of digital currency, like a bitcoin.
While you can’t hold a lumen in your hand, they are essential to the Stellar network—they contribute to the ability to move money around the world and to conduct transactions between different currencies quickly and securely.
In 2014 the Stellar network launched with 100 billion stellars, the original name of the network’s native asset.

In 2015, with the launch of the upgraded network, the name of the native asset changed from stellar to lumen to distinguish it from 1) the Stellar network itself and 2) Stellar.org, the nonprofit organization that contributes to development of the network.

APPLICATIONS
Several nonprofits and businesses are implementing Stellar as financial infrastructure, particularly in the developing world. One such example is Praekelt Foundation, which will be integrating Stellar into Vumi, its open-source messaging app, to let young girls in Sub-Saharan Africa save money in airtime credits.

Parkway, a licensed mobile money operator, uses the Stellar network to connect Nigeria’s five major telcos, enabling customers of different mobile money services to send money to one another.

Oradian, a cloud-based banking software company, also plans to use the Stellar network to connect microfinance institutions (MFIs) in Nigeria.

In December 2016 more partnerships were announced, including in the Philippines, India and West Africa.

The application will distribute WGP tokens as reward to users completing predefined GHG reduction missions, many of which will be customized for the user by an AI engine.

The partnership

The primary goal of this partnership is to create a large-scale liquidity network for WGP token holders in the WGP ecosystem. WGP token holders will be able to use WGP to make everyday purchases of real products and services in a matter of a few quick taps. Through the Zeex network, WGP token holders can look forward to spending WGP on a wide range of global brands and retailers, such as Amazon, iTunes, Google Play Store and so on.

Together with W Green Pay, we believe we can influence the public to adopt the usage of cryptocurrency through a meaningful and impactful way.”

Going forward, WGP will be integrating Zeex’s blockchain payment platform onto the HOOXI Mall — an inhouse e-commerce platform that allows WGP token holders to spend their WGP on discounted products and services offered by corporate sponsors of W-Foundation and the HOOXI campaign.

“Through this partnership, we hope to leverage on the strengths of both organizations to drive mass market adoption of the HOOXI mobile application, and provide the best user interface possible for WGP token holders.

Bob’s Repair is here to change that. The Prandecki brothers, together with blockchain experts and experienced software engineers, founded Bob's Repair with the mission of launching a decentralized platform that will bring trust and fair pricing back to the consumer. In order to fight review fraud, advertising fees and provide the consumer with transparency, the Bob's Repair Application will be built on the STEEM blockchain, which has a three second block time and no transaction costs.

About Bob's Repair
To solve review fraud, hidden costs due to advertising fees, and inflated costs to lack of pricing transparency, Bob’s Repair will build the Bob Application on the STEEM blockchain. The Bob Application will consist of a sophisticated iOS, Android, and web application.

The Bob Application leverages blockchain technology to fight review fraud. The Bob Application will be built on the STEEM blockchain due to its three second transaction time and no transaction costs. The Bob Application will store all financial transactions that take place on Bob’s Repair on the blockchain. Then, when both sides of a transaction - consumer and contractor - leave a review, Bob’s Repair will link that review to the actual financial transaction. By linking reviews with actual financial transactions, consumers can trust that the review is real and unaltered. Real reviews, from real consumers, provides better information so consumers can make better decisions.

The Bob Application will not have advertising from contractors. As a result, contractors will not pass on advertising costs to consumers. Contractors cannot buy visibility on Bob’s Repair through advertising. Rather, due to the functions of upvoting, flagging posts, and user reputation on the STEEM blockchain, visibility is governed by merit. For instance, if a contractor has more verified positive reviews, then that contractor will have a more significant presence. This structure will eliminate hidden advertising costs.

The Bob Application will have transparent pricing. Each review will provide the cost of the service, broken into the material and labor costs. Consumers will be able to easily search reviews to determine the actual material and labor costs for a certain service. This transparency will drive down prices and fight inflated costs.

A DIGITAL ASSET AS A REWARD FOR PRODUCING SOLAR POWER
ElectriCChain is an Open Science project based on blockchain technology. Originally intended to verify and publish near real-time production data of some 7 million solar plants, it is designed to help advance knowledge and enable Climate Change analysis for scientists and researchers.

SolarCoin was developed with blockchain technology to generate an additional reward for solar electricity producers. The solar installation owners registered to the SolarCoin network receive a SolarCoin for each MWh of solar electricity that they produce.

This Digital Asset will allow solar electricity producers to receive an additional reward for their contribution to the energy transition, which will develop itself through network effect.

LUMO IS A SOLARCOIN PIONEER IN FRANCE AND EUROPE
Lumo joins SolarCoin in France and Europe so that by the end of 2016 Lumo users will receive directly on their Lumo account this new form of reward to thank them for the social impact of their investment.

By acting as pioneers with this new reward, Lumo users contribute to its growth and thus, towards the valuation of this Digital Asset, as it gains recognition from businesses in the “Impact Investing” community.

Smart ID provides a new, transparent way for individuals, organisations and devices to obtain, verify and share identity credentials with one another.

Users can create and store identity attributes like an ID reference, driving licence or passport, which can be endorsed by third parties to form verifiable credentials for use within any digital interaction. The platform offers vast opportunities for the automation of identity linked processes such as customer registration or KYC (Know Your Customer).

Looking ahead, a smart identity can hold digital assets representing money or physical property, enabling users to complete complex transactions involving the exchange of ownership and other forms of value transfer, all within a single platform.

How Smart ID works
Smart ID makes it easier for customers to manage their identity information by reducing the number of places they need to maintain it, and simplifying the process of sharing it with others.

For organisations, Smart ID provides a platform for efficiently receiving and verifying customer information, and for staying up to date with changes on an ongoing basis.

Users register a Smart ID and load identity attributes into it, such as a driving licence, company registration identifier or device id (or anything else), which are private by default but can be optionally shared with others.

To build trust in this information, third parties can add revocable endorsements to each attribute to authenticate their validity.

This combination of features enables a user to obtain verifiable credentials which can be used to enable automation of identity verification processes within any digital process (such as new customer registration).

Our first use case, the Smart ID KYC Application, enables Financial Institutions of all sizes to use Smart ID to manage the end to end know your customer process for small and medium sized enterprises in a simple, digital, and cost effective way.

The LGBT Foundation will drive the adoption of the LGBT Token as a method of payment in everyday transactions for businesses both digital and physical. To jumpstart this, Hornet Networks, the sponsor of the LGBT Foundation, will adopt the Token among its 25m users—some 10% of the LGBT community worldwide—and accept the LGBT Token as a means of payment for its services.

Goals of the LGBT Token

LGBT Identity Management

Enable LGBT members to verify and protect their identities, especially in countries where they face repercussions.

Pink Economy

Harness the economic might of the worldwide LGBT community by implementing a viable payment system for goods and services.

LGBT Impact

Set aside a portion of Tokens every year to generate funding to tackle LGBT discrimination, oppression, and inequality on a global scale.

THE LGBT FOUNDATION
The Foundation is a not-for-profit organization with the mission to create the LGBT Token cryptocurrency and leverage blockchain technology to define and grow the global pink economy. The LGBT Impact branch of the Foundation will give back to the community by supporting causes and organizations that aim to advance the rights of the LGBT community around the world.

Protect the Community

Help members of the global LGBT community protect their identities in all transactions with blockchain technology.

Understand the Economy

Fully define and understand the scale and scope of the worldwide pink economy in order to help it grow.

Harness its Potential

Use the power of the pink economy to help champion LGBT causes around the world by giving back.

USECASES
One of the major challenges currently facing most cryptocurrencies is that they are not yet viable in a real world setting, or for utility use on a daily basis. The LGBT Foundation aims to overcome that hurdle by working with businesses and partners that have agreed to adopt the LGBT Token as part of their everyday transactional business models.

EXAMPLE USE CASES

Hornet Wallet
Hornet pledges to build an initial wallet as a showcase for other launch partners, including simple private key storage and backup capabilities, as well as QR code and NFC support. The wallet will allow Hornet’s 25 million users to send and receive money to and from one another, as well as purchase services and goods via Hornet. The goal is to provide a simple and intuitive interface so users can use their wallet without having any prior expertise with cryptocurrencies.

Ticket Purchase
Hornet has trusted relationships with event venues in many major cities including Paris, Sao Paulo, Taipei, and Hong Kong and aims to enable ticket purchases through various vendors using LGBT Token.

LGBT Impact
The LGBT Impact program will select individuals and nonprofit organizations that provide services to the LGBT community to receive support.

With the new record system and no one at the center who can “change history,” loans can no longer be taken away with such ease and individuals “do not have to surrender to a single trusted third party.” As a result, the use of blockchain technology for recording land titles brings a conflux of interest between the financial industry, which looks to make loans, and human rights activists, advocating to maintain people’s rights to their land while protecting their dignity and sovereignty.",,Making the World's Systems Honest,Austin,United States,,,North America,North America,2014,"Paul Snow, Founder & CEO",government,https://twitter.com/factom,https://www.facebook.com/FactomProject/,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IoJW6JMMzcI,https://www.factom.com/devs/docs/guide/factom-white-paper-1-0,,,,,,,Other,,,,Honduras,,,,,Hello@Factom.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

 Energy transitions require not only technology innovations but new market arrangements. Our processes identify demand for these new arrangements, and then source, validate and accelerate solutions.
 
 Mission:
 Today’s energy system, the cornerstone of prosperity for over a century, is operating at too high an environmental and economic cost, and is still failing to reach 1 billion people on the planet. Unlocking innovation today will allow us to most effectively tackle the energy ‘trilemma’ of low cost, low carbon and resilient energy for all. No global organisation exists today to support this innovation. Energy Unlocked aims to fill that gap.
 
 Why?:
 Energy certificates energy has been part of our energy mix for over a century, but digital, technical, social and financial innovation are changing how we buy, produce and consume electricity, and making it possible to achieve 100 per cent Energy certificates power. Traditional ""command and control"" hierarchy in current energy markets is already being disrupted by decentralised intermittent Energy certificates and 'prosumers' who now produce as well as consume electricity. This trend is unlocking new ‘flexibility’ in the demand-side of energy: we can now store energy, or automatically shift consumption patterns to match Energy certificates generation.
 
 Embracing energy innovation today will make our energy system more resilient tomorrow. The world is more complex and interconnected than ever before; what happens in one part of the world can impact far-away economies. Severe weather events and local power outages disrupting critical infrastructure can cause political or economic instability. 
 
 Supporting energy innovation means we can tackle climate change. Bloomberg New Energy Finance finds that even with 60 per cent Energy certificates by 2030, we are reaching dangerous levels of climate change within the next decade. We need to accelerate the pace of adoption of Energy certificates by enabling innovation not only in energy supply technologies, but in energy demand and storage as well.
 
 How?:
 n 2016, we ran the global Energy Productivity Innovation Challenge (EPIC) and sourced 100 companies that are part of doubling energy productivity to 2030, identified the 10 business model types that are emerging and markets where they can operate. In 2017, we are engaging corporate early adopters and leaders that will grow demand for these solutions.

Vector Chief Executive Simon Mackenzie says the trading platform allows consumers to trade surplus energy from solar panels and batteries directly with each other.

""This arrangement empowers consumers to better manage and profit from their energy supply and demand.""

Power Ledger co-founder and chair, Jemma Green believes that this kind of commercial deployment heralds the beginning of a new paradigm for energy markets globally.

""Power Ledger is simply about using technology to enable the safe, sustainable and sensible trading of energy between producers and consumers.  We are excited to be working with Vector to put the power of energy trading in the hands of every day New Zealanders"", she says.

The trial is planned to get underway in December 2016 across up to 500 sites across Auckland, including schools, community groups and households.

""This is a natural extension of our exploration of new technologies with the emergence of a new electricity network that offers consumers greater choice and control over the sources of energy they use,"" Mr Mackenzie says.

Under the trading platform people can negotiate directly with each other depending on their supply and demand.

""Even people without solar panels could buy power from their neighbours,"" Mr Mackenzie says.

""This exclusive transaction is another milestone for Power Ledger, Vector is a perfect large scale partner for us in the sunny Oceania region"" Ms Green added.

Power Ledger are the global market leader in peer-to-peer energy trading, using encryption and Blockchain technology to allowing residential and commercial users to better manage their demand and supply needs by making the most of solar panels, batteries, peak loads and other factors such as weather forecasts.

According to the International Labor Organization, nearly 25 million people work in forced-labor conditions worldwide, with 47 percent of them in the Asia-Pacific region.

Food and beverage companies are under pressure to address the risk of forced labor in countries where they obtain sugarcane. A study released last year by KnowTheChain (KTC), a partnership founded by U.S.-based Humanity United, showed that most food and beverage companies fall short in their efforts to solve the problem.

The study said Coca-Cola, one of 10 global companies looked at by KTC, has committed to conduct 28 country-level studies on child labor, forced labor, and land rights for its sugar supply chains by 2020.

The U.S. beverage giant said it has been exploring multiple blockchain projects for more than a year.

Brent Wilton, the company’s global head of workplace rights, said in an email to Reuters, “We are partnering with the pilot of this project to further increase transparency and efficiency of the verification process related to labor policies within our supply chain.”

The new venture is intended to create a secure registry for workers and their contracts using blockchain’s validation and digital notary capabilities, said Blockchain Trust Accelerator (BTA), a non-profit organization involved in the project.

BTA is a global platform for harnessing blockchain to deliver social impact.

The State Department said it will provide expertise on labor protection.

“The Department of State is excited to work on this innovative blockchain-based pilot,” Deputy Assistant Secretary Scott Busby said in an email to Reuters, noting that while blockchain cannot compel companies or those in authority to abide by the labor contracts, it can create a validated chain of evidence that will encourage compliance with those contracts.

Together, we are partnering with financial institutions, industry bodies, NGOs and governments to help the smallest businesses in developed and developing economies. We think that building and running a small business shouldn’t be as difficult, painful and risky as it is today and our goal is to make the future a fairer place to work.
 The App 
hiveonline is the financial trust platform for small businesses. As a small business owner, you can share decisions, contracts, authorisations and payments with your customers, lenders and suppliers via mobile, removing uncertainty and complexity.  
Your customers, lenders, suppliers, authorities and other businesses need to know you can be trusted so we take the administration and burden of proof away with our tailored ratings, which are based on what you’ve delivered, rather than biased reviews.
Because we run on blockchain rails, with a reputation system based on behaviour rather than bank records or government ID, we're ideally placed to bring financial inclusion to micro and small businesses who don't have access to banks, so alongside our platform for Nordic customers, we're launching financial ecosystem support for the millions of unbanked businesses in developing economies.
Trust based on facts, not opinions; Blockchain without the bullsh*t.

hiveonline community finance builds the bridge between informal financial communities and the financial system. We dramatically reduce the cost and risk of lending or other financial services to informal businesses and savings groups like CARE’s VSLA.

Our reputation system treats everyone fairly: borrowers get a score based on their financial behaviour; lenders on their performance and treatment of customers. Groups can borrow as a community.

Poor communications infrastructure, typical in rural Africa, isn’t a problem, because it’s designed for low data use and low connectivity. It runs on any phone with a browser, so users don’t need smartphones. There’s an offline mode for the most remote communities, so they can transact without any connectivity. Fully traceable transactions give confidence to lenders, aid programmes, and investors.

At this moment, most grid infrastructure can only support a limited amount (10-20%*) of renewable energy input while remaining stable, due to the fluctuating nature of renewable energy streams. Current market models are based on a largely supply-driven energy economy which lacks the flexibility needed to allow for higher penetration of renewables. New, intelligent ways of managing energy supply and demand, combined with innovative business models, are needed in order to effectively manage our transition towards a clean energy economy. Our long-term vision is to develop scalable solutions that will revolutionize the way we provide for all of our core resources, focusing on the key areas needed for leading a healthy and fruitful life: energy, water, sanitation, food, shelter, and resource recovery. As our global population expands, the demand for energy and natural resources increases with it, putting more pressure on our already stressed planetary boundaries. It is visible across the board – from marine life and aquifers, to oil supplies and rare earth metals – we are rapidly depleting these finite resources and polluting our environment at alarming rates. As global supply chains become increasingly volatile and centralized systems are further strained, the number of people without adequate resource provision will continue to grow. Solving all of the challenges we face around resource security is a highly ambitious and long-term mission. The most we can do is to contribute our full efforts to help overcome the obstacles we face on our journey towards a sustainable future We believe that one of the most urgent issues is to solve the challenges for providing for our energy needs in a sustainable way. Not only is access to energy essential for high quality of life, but virtually everything is reliant on an input of energy. Our entire global socio-economic eco-system has been built upon a foundation of fossil fuels – everything from growing food to resource extraction and water purification. Leveraging the full potential of the nearly unlimited source of energy from the sun is the first step towards dealing with the rest of the systemic challenges we’ve encountered.

CommonsHood allows users to create new kinds of tokens simply via the app or its web interface, while, currently, this possibility resides only in the hands of technologists. Thus, CommonsHood creates an “Internet of Value 2.0” revolution analogous to the “Web 2.0” revolution, that allowed everyone, not just programmers, to publish their own contents on the Internet.

The goal of CommonsHood is to democratize local financial instruments: it allows communities to create new types of tokens to support financial inclusion and to increase the sustainability of the local economy. In particular, it provides commons and associations with instruments to help finance themselves issuing tokens representing prepaid cards, crowdfunding, complementary currencies, and to share tools and infrastructures using tokens representing access rights. It provides small retailers with tokens representing loyalty tools. It provides institutions with purpose-driven tokens to reward volunteers. It allows the dematerialization of tickets and collectibles. All tokens can be distributed to the Wallet app of other users, directly or via websites, QR codes, or via proximity marketing using geolocalization.

The use of Blockchain allows us to construct an open, decentralized and disintermediated infrastructure to avoid the fees of and data control by platforms such as group-buying or crowdfunding websites. It allows citizens to use a single general-purpose app for multiple services, rather than many different ones, each for a different association and retailer, that will never reach a critical mass of users. And, above all, Blockchain allows new communities to replicate the CommonsHood infrastructure without the need for each to have their own trusted party.

CommonsHood has been developed by the University of Turin in collaboration with grassroot initiatives such as the Collaboration Pacts signed by citizens with the Municipality of Turin within the context of the new legislation on commons. CommonsHood will be trialled in the next few months in Turin and Athens with urban commoners, solidarity movements, institutions and associations of retailers, and the Wallet app is offered for use to all further initiatives in the territory.",,"The “Internet of Value 2.0” revolution for social innovation in communities.

 We are drowning in information of uncertain veracity.
 
 We store 2.5M times more digital info than 40 years ago. While digital info access has increased exponentially, our ability to process information has stayed the same.
 
 Today's Internet of pages connected by links optimizes for linear reading. But it is poor for processing large amounts of info and discerning accuracy.
  
 Hence, today's Internet is overwhelming, confusing, and fraught with contentious and disingenuous info.
 
 Misinformation causes confusion and misleads people to believe things that are false or to disbelieve things that are true. Pew Research found that 71% of US adults sometimes or often see made-up political news online. Misleading information is sufficiently prevalent such that only 4% of U.S. adults have a lot of trust in info on social media.
 
 The overwhelming amount and uncertain veracity of info leads to apathy, inaction, and poor choices on the individual and collective basis that threaten our survival.
 
 The Solution
 Bridgit is making the web more like the human brain with respect to connectedness. Bridgit decentralizes linking so users can build “bridges” on any page that connect information on an idea by idea basis - pieces of text, image, video, and/or audio - and have a relationship (eg., supporting). 
 
 Bridgit is a browser overlay. When a user comes to a page where a bridge has been built and focuses their attention near the bridge, an overlay will display the available bridges. Users can also make notes, start conversations, and initiate collaborations on any page. Activities can be private, public, or visible only to specific communities of interest. 
 
 Bridgit provides an unprecedented opportunity for advocacy and community-based organizations and their local audiences to connect as networked communities of engaged citizens around common interests. Communities can work together to inform themselves about the local issues and resources that are most relevant to their lives.
 
 How We Are Innovative
 We decentralize the link and connect publicly available information on an idea-by-idea basis through “bridges.” As communities connect ideas across pages and topics, patterns will reveal themselves, and more truth and understanding will rise to the surface of human consciousness as collective cognitive breakthroughs, thereby revealing paths towards resolution of seemingly intractable problems like Climate Change.
 
 Bridgit is a browser overlay so it’s available on every page and enables the community to expose false news right where it is. We enable users to earn tokens for the value they create in the network. We support discovery orders of magnitude more effective than search.",,A map for the internet.

Capitalism needs a reset, says the Financial Times, accompanied by the CEOs of digital platform giants. But no-one knows how to proceed after such a reboot. We may be on our way to fundamental changes in the structure of our economy.

Peer-to-peer technologies, such as Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs, including blockchains) are providing completely new opportunities to organise our society. However, technologies are just enablers. We must set a direction for these developments. We must proactively conduct large scale experiments with alternative economic structures. The future of our society must rely not solely on ideologies, but on solid experiments and data.

Our Generalised Merits (GMeRitS) endeavour aims to tackle this huge predicament by taking baby steps towards wide scale experiments with alternative economic structures. In particular, our aim is to try and evaluate various anti-rival compensation and governance structures.

OUR VISION
Our vision is based on intimate interconnection of three themes: money and debt shaping our collective thinking, market failures especially in the data markets, and the invention of DLTs.

Money and debt, as we know them today, are arguably among the most important social innovationswithin the last 5000 years. According to some scholars, those innovations have even shaped the way we perceive ourselves as individuals and how we relate to each other. The innovation in these domains has not stopped: on the contrary, it is accelerating with a rapid pace.
There is early but growing evidence that the current forms of ownership and payment are insufficient to efficiently clear new kinds of markets our society is increasingly based on, especially those related with information and data. We are evidencing structural market failures, evidenced by the birth of the giant data monopolies and the accumulation of “knowledge silos.”
Industrial revolution continues, and DLTs are one of its latest manifestations. DLTsmay be considered as the most potential accounting innovation since the 15th century, when double entry bookkeeping became commonplace. However, DLTs are not economic solutions themselves. Although DLTs enable governance decentralisation, tamper proofness, censor-resistance and resilience, the technology is still free to be exploited almost to whatever ideological and political purpose one wants.
We surmise that these themes – including societal pressures and technological possibilities – will lead to a very fundamental change in the way we perceive the economy and even ourselves. Careful institutional experiments and design is needed to set a direction for these developments. GMeRitS is carrying out these experiments.

OUR WORK
Currently, GMeRitS consists of three empirical cases – REC currency, Mesensei community empowerment framework, and Merits rewarding system – and a continuously updated design toolkit to be used by anyone willing to develop their own frameworks based on our principles. Together these components form the fundamental building blocks of our economic, technological, and conceptual experiments.

Using DLT based infrastructure and mobile apps, based on already ongoing community experiments of REC, Mesensei and Merits, and gradually expanding thereof, we are experimenting and systematically studying collaborative economic structures, contributing to financial inclusion.",,Generalised Merits for Respect and Social Equality,,Finland,,,Europe,Northern Europe,2019,,"academic, partnership",,,,,,,,,https://github.com/GMeRitS,,,Not known,Not known,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Earn Healthcoins with healthy choices and spend them on things that are good for you

A long and happy life is something that we all want. Health is an important condition for this and at the same time something that we do not always strive to achieve. It helps to make healthy choices on a daily basis. That is a very important starting point for Healthcoin: we see health as a 'thing' to be influenced every day.

To encourage you to make healthy choices more often, such as making a fresh salad instead of buying a pizza, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator, we introduce Healthcoin; a concrete reward for healthy behavior. The principle is simple. You make healthy choices, earn hard Euro's in the form of Healthcoins and then spend these Healthcoins on things that are good for you.

Besides that everyone with healthy choices can earn coins, there are also organized challenges. These are extra challenges in which participants compete against each other and earn a prize. For example, the municipality can start the 'Which neighborhood should most Healthcoins earn in May?' Competition, with a new football pitch for young people from the neighborhood as prize. Challenges make healthy choices even more enjoyable and even more profitable. School against school, class against class, sports club against sports club, street against street, client against client; everything is possible, as long as your health benefits.

We aim to create innovative, collaborative solutions, based on the blockchain's guarantees of a secure, robust and transparent platform. We will do this at the lowest cost whilst providing the greatest benefit to all market participants.Decarbonisation: As wind and solar generation comes to represent an increasing proportion of our power generation mix, our electricity supply-base is increasingly intermittent and inflexible. Since electrical supply and demand have to be matched on a continuous basis, we need more demand-side flexibility.Decentralisation:Unlike traditional centralised coal plants, renewable assets are often connected to the local grid. This presents an opportunity to increase grid efficiency and reduce transmission losses. It also introduces new challenges such as two-way power flows, a need for greater visibility and integration of decentralised assets and introduces the potential for new, locational pricing models.Digitsation: Rapid developments in smart grid technologies, artificial intelligence (AI), home energy management system (HEMS), Internet of Things (IoT) and other connected devices offer greater visibility and control than ever before. It also creates new requirements for co-ordination, interpretation and data security.Democratisation: Increasing desire for a more active role in the energy market has lead to the rise of ""prosumers"" who seek to generate their own electricity from personal or shared community assets, and/or purchase energy directly through peer-to-peer (P2P) transactions. Production is becoming more ‘democratic’ with more parties participating in the energy value proposition. We design efficient, robust and innovation friendly systems to support the Industry’s transition to smart grid infrastructure and new market norms of decarbonisation, decentralisation, digitisation and democratisation. Products: - Meter Registration Platform: A shared registration platform for all UK gas and electricity supply points to facilitate faster switching. This technology is now being extended to cover new types of assets. - Flexiblity Trading Project: A common trading venue for all demand-side response actions to enable collaborative trading in the current hierarchical system as well as peer-to-peer and micro-grid trading. - Community Energy Projects: In a decentralising & democratising energy system, coordination of millions of distributed energy resources & trading interests is key to maximising system value.

Individuals suffering from kidney failure today face significant challenges to obtain a transplant. 
They are placed on a waiting list in hope that a kidney from a deceased donor is a transplant match.
However, they do have another option: a living donor; someone they know, family or friend, willing to give them a kidney.
Unfortunately, these people may not be a transplant match, however there is a solution called “Kidney Exchange” or “Kidney Paired Donation”.
In these programs, if two mismatched pairs (living donor and kidney recipient) can be grouped together to become transplant match, both kidney failure patients can receive a kidney. 
While a great solution, these programs have a significant pitfall.  They are limited in terms of geographical scope.

*Solution*
Kidner is a platform that helps healthcare facilities finding match for kidney paired-donation.
It's a global database, Blockchain-based, secured with cryptographic tools.

,PB contributor (add or edit): : Benjamin,Positiveblockchain,,,Khalid: Free speech is good! But uncontrolled free speech is propbably not something we should promote. I checked the platform and it's containing hate speech and racist ideologies.,0.442,323,Gab,Active,https://gab.com/,Digital content & Arts,Digital content & Arts,Newsrooms & Journalism,Newsrooms & Journalism,,,,"9, 16",,,,",9,16,",2,"a social network that supports free speech, individual liberty, and the free flow of information","Gab is building a revolutionary ad-free, censor-proof social media protocol created for people who believe in free speech, individual liberty and the free flow of information online. 

Given the current state of the digital landscape, there is only an illusion of choice when it comes to what technology products and services may be used to communicate, network, find information and discover news online. 

But the general public is gradually coming to see that their internet experience is increasingly being shaped and influenced by a handful of companies with their own special interests and agendas at stake.

At Gab, we believe in the power of people and the strength of community.  Our goal is to keep the social web grounded in the freedom of expression, information and speech.

Reserve shares in Gab to join and support a growing global community of people committed to free speech unencumbered by regulatory interference from special interests or the old guard of Silicon Valley. In order to be true to its mission and maintain its exclusive place as the world's first and only ad-free social network, Gab must be owned, powered and funded by you - The People.

Our mission is to provide everyone with a censorship-proof social networking protocol that champions free speech, individual liberty, and the free flow of information online.

The Exodus Protocol
Gab started as a single, centralized application built on top of the existing internet infrastructure. We soon learned that centralized gatekeepers could prevent anyone from building and distributing an application, stifling innovation and market opportunity. After realizing this empirically when Gab was rejected from Apple's App Store for ""objectionable content,"" removed from Google's Play Store for ""hate speech,"" and threatened by our domain registrar for the same reasons: we knew that it was time for a new solution. 

Our vision is to evolve beyond one application by empowering developers from around the world to build on top of an open peer-to-peer social media protocol. We are calling this the Exodus Protocol and will be building on top of existing open sourced peer-to-peer technology to create a new peer-to-peer social media protocol of our own. We recognize that existing blockchain technology has many limitations including latency, cost, scalability, and a rapidly evolving ecosystem. While we are excited by the future potential of many projects in the blockchain space, we believe that building on top of existing peer-to-peer protocols such as the Dat Project, IPFS, and existing cryptographic peer-to-peer protocols are the best immediate path forward to getting the Exodus Protocol off the ground. 

Peer-to-peer connections and exchanges of value are paramount to our vision for the Exodus Protocol. With this in mind, we've determined that an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) is the crowdfunding approach that aligns most directly with Gab's market offering.  We believe that, like many of our users, investors in Gab will be supportive of a crowdfunding campaign that champions a decentralized and truly democratic approach to raising capital. The crypto community inherently understands the importance of defending a free and open exchange of ideas on the web. Our aim is to empower everyone, not simply VCs or the 1%, to participate in our ICO. Unlike many ICOs, Gab has an existing product, customers, brand, and track record of success. We are seeking partners who share our longterm vision for the future and want to help us build a protocol that defends the freedom we love for generations to come. 

The primary objective of this ICO fundraising campaign is to establish an Open Developer Ecosystem for the Exodus Protocol.  We will follow these key steps to make this happen:

Incentivizing developers to build on top of the Exodus Protocol
Recruiting select developers who have been scorned by 'Big Social'
Providing an open source protocol that any developer can contribute to or build on

The Exodus Protocol stands for bringing people together of all races, religions, and creeds who share in the common ideals of Western values around individual liberty and the free exchange of ideas. 

Here at Gab, we put people first, providing them with the tools they need to create and shape their own online experience. Gab was launched to appeal to consumers unhappy with censorship. Like other social media platforms, Gab allows users to upload and stream their own videos - but then distinguishes itself by not censoring content based on viewpoint. The Exodus Protocol will compete against pre-existing platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Facebook others by appealing to digital consumers who oppose political and/or ideological censorship.

Free, Legal Speech
From its inception, Gab has been committed to appealing to people of all races, backgrounds and political persuasions who support the free flow of information.  As Co-Founder & CEO Andrew Torba said upon its launch, “Gab is not FOR any particular group of people, political leaning, race, beliefs, or anything.  Anybody is welcome to express themselves on Gab.”

Of course Gab does not advocate hate speech.  In fact, Gab terms state that it “treats all people with respect and dignity, regardless of their background, origins and point of view.”

But while Gab prohibits rhetoric that advocates violence or illegal activity and allows users to block hateful speech, Gab does not forbid any speech based solely on viewpoint.",,A censorship-proof P2P social protocol,Clarks Summit,United States,,,North America,North America,2016,"Andrew Torba, Co-Founder & CEO",corporate,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/gab-ai-inc./about/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLgBOcZhuJc,,,,,,,Not known,Not known,,,,,,,,,legal@gab.ai,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Small co-operatives are currently by far the best way to improve efficiency in developing countries and help farmers retain a bigger share of their crop value. Co-ops presently rely on paper-based records, verbal promises, and complicated agreements; this frequently causes critical problems due to lack of transparency, restricted access to price data, lying, graft, and corruption.

AgriLedger is a Mobile App that records and transacts incorruptible truth using blockchain technology. It is a complete framework of integrated services for delivering an even playing field to farmers and co-ops. This solid framework of trust allows everyone to know they are working, buying, selling, and sharing things according to a cryptographic “Book of Truth” that is utterly incorruptible.

THE IDEA
AgUnity Streamlines Co-Operative Operations By Putting A Simple Distributed Cryptoledger Mobile App Into The Hand Of Every Small Farmer.

Blockchain
All transactions are permanently recorded on an incorruptible Blockchain ledger.

Network
Build the world's largest network of small farmers and cooperatives.

FOOD SECURITY
Using Simple Technology, We Can Make Small Improvements That Will Have A Life Changing Impact For Billions Of People!

One-third of the world’s available food either spoils or gets thrown away before it ever reaches a plate—that’s enough to feed everyone in the world for two months. And with 1.2 billion people food insecure or undernourished, millions of vulnerable smallholder farmers losing profits they can’t spare, and a population expected to increase by 2 billion by 2050, we cannot afford to allow these losses to continue. – Rockefeller Foundation

On 470 million smallholder farms across Africa, lack of access to training and technology negatively impacts harvests and farmers livelihoods.

When crops and food exports don’t make it to market, the economic development and global competitiveness of agriculture-dependent nations suffer as well.

50% food produced in Africa is wasted.

According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nation (FAO), the amount of food wasted on the continent is enough to feed 300 million people. The statistics of food production compared to hunger suggest that Africa actually produces more than enough to feed itself.

THE CO-OPERATIVE
Farmers Join Together In Co-Ops To Overcome The Challenges But Are Still Facing The Lack Of Following

1 Trust
Lack of trust between co-op staff and farmers.

2 Efficiency
Paper-based systems are labor intensive, error prone and difficult for locals to understand.

3 Audit
No audit trail enables corruption and graft.

Connecting patients directly to medical research and incentivizing them to share their data with tokens, blockchain is the decentralized technology everyone was waiting for to move away from the current linear process of drug approvals, to a new iterative model where trustworthy digital health data is shared in real time between patients, life sciences and regulators. The 21st Century Cures Act (2016) gave the FDA a mandate to accelerate approvals if more patient real world data was shared proactively by pharma. Embleema's blockchain speeds up this process with patient buy-in, accelerating time to market new drugs.

Dash & Bitrefill partnership
The partnership will allow Dash customers to pay for their mobile recharge phone, monthly bills, and vouchers for prepaid mobile services, as well as the gaming platform Steam, through Bitrefill’s platform. Bitrefill, which currently supports Bitcoin and Litecoin as forms of payment, indicated strong demand from customers to integrate Dash due to its low fees, and near instant transaction speeds.

“Dash’s ability to transact at near Visa like speeds with our InstantSend feature, as well as enable double-spend protected transactions, make it ideal for commerce partners like Bitrefill,” stated Dash Director of Global Business Bradley Zastrow. “We offer a solution that eliminates fraud while also providing an extremely fast form of payment, critical to the user experience. As a bonus, Dash will soon be offering a 10% discount when buying either phone or Steam vouchers using Dash through Bitrefill’s platform.”

Both Dash and Bitrefill share a similar mission to help service the underbanked and unbanked across the globe. As a result, both companies currently boast significant, overlapping customer bases in several countries- such as Venezuela, Chile, and Zimbabwe- that are plagued by the effects of hyperinflation and insufficient financial services such as digital payments providers. The new partnership will help both companies continue their expansion in these critical markets, offering cheaper, more efficient alternative payment methods to users.

“We service underbanked communities around the world, and Dash’s InstantSend transactions and low fees will further help these communities,” explained Bitrefill CEO Sergej Kotliar. “We look forward to working with the Dash community to make paying for prepaid mobile phones more affordable and efficient.”

Crowdfund Insider asked both platforms about Goldman Sachs Global Head of Investment Research Steven Strongin’s biting appraisal of the token and digital currency emerging market:

“I agree with the Goldman Sachs’ report in that many of today’s cryptocurrencies will cease to exist at some point in the future,” responded Dash Director of Global Business, Bradley Zastrow via email. “There are too many coins that have a hyper specific purpose, some without even solid projects or roadmaps. To that extent, we probably are in a bubble at the industry level, but like the Goldman Sachs’ report pointed out, there will be clear winners. In my view, it’s the coins who a) solve a specific problem, b) have a strong governance structure and c) have a sustainable funding model which allows for proactive growth, like Dash, who will be the survivors.”

Sergej Kotliar, Bitrefill CEO, concurred, also via email,

“I agree with the sentiment. There is currently a lot of hype in the field, overblown expectations and inflated valuations. That said, I am incredibly bullish on cryptocurrencies as a long-term invention, and upcoming technologies such as payment channels (Lightning networks), that will let cryptocurrencies fulfill the original promise of being ‘instant and cheap,’ while also maintaining a high level of decentralization.”

It is a product by the government of Kenya through the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) under the National Treasury in collaboration with Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE), Central Depository Settlement Corporation (CDSC), Safaricom, Airtel and Kenya Association of Stock Brokers & Investment Banks (KASIB).

The pilot phase of this first-of-a-kind mobile-only government bond for US$1.5 million was launched in March 2017 with transactions ranging from US$30 to US$140.
With Blockchain beneath the new project, its key asset of ensuring transaction immutability having eliminated the need for an enforcer of trust in the ecosystem would be valuable for M-Akiba.

Apart from proposing to support with market research on assessing the use of Fintech technology particularly Blockchain to simplify the platforms backing the system, the Bank's team will also help with improvements to the product to fit the profile of the unbanked potential savers (instead of the 3-year bond) and institutional set ups to manage the platform to eliminate intermediation layers between the Treasury and investors.

The visitor of a cultural event consumes on the spot, thus interacting indirectly with the artists he/she has come to see, as well as with all the professionals making this event happen. This is where Blockchain My Art jumps in, by making this relation transparent and interactive, giving the visitor a clear picture of the way his/her money is being split among the beneficiaries.

For every product sold using our system, the value of each purchase (tickets, drinks, food, etc.) can be directly and immediately split and sent to defined actors (potentially any contributor from the value chain: suppliers, contractors, artists, volunteers, local associations, etc.), using so-called smart contracts.

GrainChain’s vision is to create a software ecosystem that empowers farmers in the global grain industry who wouldn’t normally have the budget to invest in certain technologies.

GrainChain wants to level the playing field and reduce the number of intermediaries needed to complete a transaction. GrainChain does this by providing a transaction platform for the sale and purchase of grain and other commodities.

Overall, GrainChain helps farmers engage with more buyers and increases trust and transparency throughout the value chain so that all actors can access information on the quality of the seed. In many instances it helps farmers increase profitability. For GrainChain, this starts in the fields of South Texas, where more than 1,000 farmers use its platform to generate smart contracts for the sale and purchase of grain. The farmers are paid instantly, and buyers receive immediate title to the commodity.

GrainChain runs its platform with the help of blockchain technology. It works with two systems: a logistics system called HarvX and a grain governance system called SiloSys that tracks and maintains movement of a seed from the producer to the farm, including data on the origin of the seed, authentication of the seed, and seed storage.

GrainChain’s blockchain solution is designed to collaborate with existing software systems that use its API. Therefore, GrainChain’s platform records all of this collected data in an immutable record that is perpetually linked to the commodity and the participants.

When a farmer has a certain quantity of grain to sell, the farmer creates a smart contract sales agreement with all the sales terms defined — including logistics, storage, pest control, quality of the grain, and location — on GrainChain’s platform. The buyer can then evaluate the information on the smart contract and add variables to it. By accepting this smart contract, the buyer is effectively accepting the terms that the farmer included.

GrainChain’s platform then calculates the net value for the contract and digitally escrows the buyer’s funds. Once the grain is delivered to the agreed-upon settlement location, it is verified by the system, and the buyer’s funds are automatically put into the farmer’s GrainChain wallet and converted to the local currency, which cuts out international banking and transfer fees.",,,MacAllen,United States,,,North America,North America,2013,,corporate,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/grainchainio/about/,,,,,,,,,Not Known,Not Known,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Chronicled secures IoT device identities, data, and event logs and automates IoT-dependent business logic through smart contracts. Chronicled is also a founding member of the Trusted IoT Alliance, with the mission of creating open source tools and standards to connect IoT and blockchain ecosystems to deliver business value.

Our Mission
Ultimately, we care most about bringing trust to global commerce and society. We are committed to empowering businesses to leverage blockchain technology to improve all aspects of their supply chains and operations. We believe in open source IP and collaboration, which is why we are a founding member of the Trusted IoT Alliance.

IoT, Blockchain, AI, and Mobile Combine to Offer Groundbreaking Anti-Counterfeit Solutions
It is the combination of hardware and software that enables the creation of secure identities and brand protection.  In the past several years, all of these components have seen rapid technological advancement, to the point that businesses are now able to offer B2B product provenance tracking and end-consumer authentication systems that are virtually bulletproof.

PROBLEM
Approximately $2 trillion per year of luxury products are counterfeited.
Serial number, QR code, UPC code, and barcode systems are all easily cloned and copied.
Brands lack a complete understanding of the full solution space involved in making identity and IoT chip selection decisions.
Brands are ill-equipped to assess the trade-offs in identity and IoT chip selection decisions, i.e. cost, clone-ability, security, consumer verification, inventory scanning.
Low security identity chips are insufficient to support supply chain automation or M2M identity verification and payments.

OUR SOLUTION
Choose the optimal set of product and IoT identity solutions to best serve your company's goals.
Understand trade-offs inherent in various IoT chip security models.
Multi-Identity Compatibility:  SSN, SGTIN, Bar Code, QR Code, UID, NFC, BLE, PKI.

The Internet is missing a layer for secure identity which is currently costing us hundreds of billions of dollars each year. The Sovrin Foundation is showing the world that when we control our own identities, many exciting and liberating possibilities are at our fingertips.
 
Providing an enduring solution for global identity requires significant effort and careful planning. The Sovrin Foundation exists to provide the human governance and trust frameworks that will be needed to establish ground rules and ensure the integrity of the network. To be effective at this task, the Sovrin Foundation has been designed to establish trust through transparency, diffusion, and neutrality.
 
The Sovrin Foundation has intentionally invited board members to represent expertise from across multiple industries and geographies, ensuring that special interests – whether commercial, governmental, or otherwise – do not unduly influence decisions. Our intent is to devise a process so that the elected Board of Trustees will be representative of the people and organizations who own identities on the Sovrin network. Furthermore, the Technical Governance Board will oversee the evolution of the open source code run by each node.
 
Sovrin Foundation is a non-profit. We don’t actually own the network – no one does, much like the Internet itself. The Sovrin network is public: everyone can get a Sovrin identity. Individuals and organizations own and control their identities. The Sovrin network is permissioned: the infrastructure for ensuring consensus on identity transactions is provided by carefully vetted and permissioned stewards who independently own and operate their nodes on the network. These combine to form a system of checks and balances that earns trust through action rather than promises.

Identity for all - Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is an identity that is 100% owned and controlled by an individual or organization. No one else can read it, use it, turn it off, or take it away without its owner’s explicit consent. This simple form of identity is private, extremely secure, and goes where you go.

Grant Brooke, co-founder the $13 million start-up explains, “Previously, we were focused on helping farmers distribute bananas, tomatoes, onions and potatoes to 2,600 kiosks across Kenya, but we soon realized that we could help them sell even more produce with access to working capital. It’s simple, if the food vendors can sell more, we can distribute more, growing both of our businesses.”

Brooke didn’t have far to look and formed a collaboration with IBM scientists in Nairobi to build and test a blockchain-enabled finance lending platform. But there was a catch. How could loans be provided when most of the vendors lack a credit score?

Luckily, IBM scientists know a thing or two about using machine learning and mobile data and how to apply both towards developing credit scores – they’ve done it before. In a previous project with an African bank and mobile operator more than $3 million in loans were distributed.

Twiga
All of the loans were managed by blockchain and executed via mobile phone SMS.

“We analyzed purchase records from a mobile device and then apply machine learning algorithms to predict credit worthiness, in turn giving lenders the confidence they need to provide microloans to small businesses. Once the credit score is determined, we used a blockchain, based on the Hyperledger Fabric, to manage the entire lending process from application to receiving offers to accepting the terms to repayment,” said Isaac Markus, a researcher on the inclusive financial services group at IBM Research in Kenya.

With blockchain, the lending process becomes transparent to all permissioned parties involved, from the lending bank to the borrower’s bank and the loan applicant themselves. Blockchains are immutable, helping to reduce fraud, since no one single party can append the blockchain without consensus from the enti

re network. Finally, blockchains employ a series of “smart contracts” which can be executed in real time, having the potential to significantly reduce the time it takes to manually process and issue a loan.

To test the new platform Twiga Foods and IBM ran a pilot at the end of last year with 220 small food kiosks, known locally as “mama mbogas” in Swahili, across Kenya.

Twiga
From left to right: Abdigani Diriye, manager, microfinance team, IBM Research – Africa; Grant Brooke, CEO and co-founder, Twiga Foods; Kevin Gakuru, small business owner and Andrew Kinai, software engineer, IBM Research – Africa

The eight-week pilot processed more than 220 loans with the average loan around $30 (3,020 KES), which increased the order size by 30 percent and profits for each retailer, on average, by six percent. The loans were for four and eight days with an interest rate of one and two percent, respectively.

All of the loans were executed via mobile phone and went directly toward working capital for the businesses. When a retailer had an order delivered, they would get an SMS with loan options for financing that order. They would then respond to the SMS confirming the loan option they preferred.

“We had several iterations of the platform based on feedback from the retailers. The SMS-based solution provided an effective channel for a diverse set of users, some with limited IT literacy, to access financing for their orders,” said Andrew Kinai, the lead software engineer on the project at IBM Research.

Based on the success of the pilot, the plan is for the platform to be rolled out to more SMEs across Africa by the end of the year and expanded into new sectors.",,Blockchain-Based MicroFinancing for Food Kiosk Owners in Kenya,Nairobi,Kenya,,,Africa,Eastern Africa,2013,,start-up,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/twiga-foods/about/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_bvoV796dE,,,,,,,Private,Hyperledger,,,IBM,Kenya,Africa,Eastern Africa,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","Today, astronomical values are circulating throughout the public, private and third sector ecosystems. Yet, trillions of dollars are persistently unaccounted for. As a result, public trust in how funds are being spent is falling. The status quo becomes increasingly under threat; funding levels are unsustainable for the long-term future and stakeholders struggle to justify continuous support. It is those who are on the receiving end of these services that suffer the greatest impact. Inconsistent services and growing threats around what resources are available to them risk leaving the most vulnerable further disadvantaged.

We believe data, leveraged in a way that empowers both organisations and end-users, is the key to addressing these major challenges. Access to transparent and trusted data offers organisations the capability of transforming how services are delivered. Decision making becomes data-led.

The digitization of transactions and data provides a more efficient way of working across the supply chain, including growers, processors, shippers, retailers, regulators, and consumers.

The solution provides authorized users with immediate access to actionable food supply chain data, from farm to store and ultimately the consumer. The complete history and current location of any individual food item, as well as accompanying information such as certifications, test data and temperature data, are readily available in seconds once uploaded onto the blockchain.

The software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution is working to ensure that trust enables, rather than hinders, the expanding food system. With capabilities for safer food, longer shelf lives, reduced waste, faster traceability, and better access to shared information, IBM Food Trust can empower you to meet the new standard for transparency and trust.

“It is not just about building the technology, it is about building the ecosystem,” Brigid McDermott, vice president for blockchain business development at IBM, said.

Wal-Mart said in June that blockchain trials had helped it narrow the time it took to trace the movement of mangoes to 2.2 seconds from about seven days.

According to a report by the Fast Company, Shahram Ebadollahi, IBM's chief science officer revealed the partnership during an event hosted on Monday.

Ebadollahi said that that the effort is an extension of the tech giant's existing research initiative with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Announced earlier this year, that initiative with the FDA is aimed at testing a blockchain-based platform through which electronic medical records, clinical trials, and health data gathered from wearable devices could be better shared.

""This is, in essence, an extension of the work we've been doing this year with the FDA...exploring owner-mediated data exchange using blockchain,"" Ebadollahi remarked at the event.

Indeed, the CDC is no stranger to the technology. Last month, as reported by CoinDesk, the CDC - which operates within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and is chiefly responsible for preventing and responding to disease outbreaks - is looking at the tech as a way to capture critical information during crisis situations more effectively.

BMG operates by augmenting the traditional energy grid, letting participants tap into community resources to generate, store, buy, and sell energy at the local level. This model makes clean, renewable energy more accessible, and keeps the community resilient to outages in emergencies, among many other economic and environmental benefits.

ABOUT
Brooklyn Microgrid is developing a community-powered microgrid here in Brooklyn. This means our participants can engage in a sustainable energy network and choose their preferred energy sources, locally.

 A microgrid can operate independently from the larger grid during power outages; providing the neighborhood with a safe, resilient energy grid that can serve as a backup in case of emergencies.

OUR MISSION

Increase the amount of clean, renewable energy generated in Brooklyn by members of the community.
?
Develop a connected network of distributed energy resources which will improve electrical grid resiliency and efficiency.

?Manage these distributed energy resources during power outages and emergencies to protect the community and local economy.

For every 1kWh of green energy consumers pay 1 NRGcoin directly to the Smart Contract. This ratio (1kWh=1NRGcoin) always holds, regardless the retail value of electricity. The Smart Contract then pays all grid fees and taxes to the DSO from the coins paid by the consumer. The Smart Contract then validates the reported injection of green energy by prosumers using a variety of methods.

If all reports check out, the Smart Contract mints new NRGcoins and rewards prosumers for their injected green energy. Prosumers can then sell those coins on a currency market, or use them to pay for green energy later on. The currency market is where consumers buy their NRGcoins from in order to pay for their consumption. When energy is paid, the associated coins are not destroyed, but remain in circulation.

Winners of the 2019 United Nations World Summit Awards,"BitDegree is one of the global leaders in the field of Blockchain in Education, recognized as one of the leading EdTech startups in Europe and in 2019 has won the World Summit Awards by the UN in the Education category, given to solutions that improve society. BitDegree has developed a global blockchain credentialing system that can be used by online & traditional education institutions. Moreover, the system allows for transfer of economic value tied to educational achievements. In response to the Prize, BitDegree has developed BitDegree Scholarships. It is an open-source autonomous global credentials and scholarships solution that learners, educational institutions / charities and donors can use today.

BitDegree Scholarships Showcase was launched on the BitDegree Platform (570k learners) in August 2019 and has already received significant interest. Learners can request micro-scholarships tied to courses on the BitDegree Platform and get it once they complete learning as proven by a blockchain certificate. Education donors can choose to sponsor individual learners with a micro-scholarship and know for sure that the learning has happened as the funds will leave the smart-contract only once the blockchain certificate was issued. This Showcase completely eliminates intermediaries from the education donations and allows for Peer-2-Peer donations with full transparency and traceability.

The autonomous nature of the solution enables micro-scholarships to become the catalyst for education donations and online learning, similarly to how micro-financing was to financial inclusion. Moreover, the Showcase is focusing on reskilling and up-skilling into digital careers, which is an enormous need and an opportunity globally, especially in the context of inclusion of the disadvantaged populations. The European labour-force also needs to transform itself to remain competitive in the Digital Age and it must do in a way that does no leave out the most vulnerable ones, such as refugees.

The Prize is encouraging BitDegree to innovate beyond what investors are comfortable with and, if won, will be used for further Scholarships solution development beyond the state-of-the-art and global scaling of it. Lastly, the Prize would give awareness and credibility to the solution for it to be adopted by the masses.",,Gain knowledge and get your dream job: learn to earn.,Vilnius,Lithuania,,,Europe,Northern Europe,2017,,start-up,https://twitter.com/bitdegree_learn,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuckLtuInNY&feature=youtu.be,https://www.bitdegree.org/bitdegree-vision.pdf,,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/bitdegree/,,,Public,Ethereum,,,Vilnius University,Global,Global,Global,,,hello@bitdegree.org,,Danielius Stasiulis,Danielius@bitdegree.org,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are on a quest to help reclaim our privacy.

Mysterium foundation is developing Mysterium Network – an open source software, powering a decentralized network of VPN Nodes. 

Mysterium Network acts as a marketplace, its Open Source software allows anyone to join the network both as a provider – selling unused network traffic or as a customer –  buying VPN service from other Mysterium Network providers.

Mysterium Network is based on a complex architecture revolving around P2P, Blockchain, Smart Contracts, State Channels, etc. The protocol will enable the creation of completely decentralized VPN network, powered by decentralized micro payments.

What is Mysterium Network?
Mysterium Network aims to be fully decentralized, peer to peer based and serverless VPN  node network, designed to provide privacy restoring techniques to its users and financial incentivization to its node operators (providers).

How Mysterium Network is different from other VPN providers?
Mysterium Network will work by utilizing blockchain technology such as Ethereum, smart contracts advancing their features with state-channels and evolving mechanisms of promises, combined with censorship evasion protocols developed by the community acting as applications of the network.

What if someone misuses my VPN Node network?
Mysterium will deploy technological and legal means to make sure node operators are safe:
I’st we will focus on protecting node operators from legal perspective,
II’nd we will implement an ingrained reputation & trust mechanisms (based on Registered Identities defined in whitepaper)
and finally we will develop a traffic routing mechanism which would combine splitting request data through different nodes and changing the end-to-end circuit between requests.

How much will Mysterium cost per month or per mb of bandwidth for the end user?
Cost ot Mysterium services will be defined by the node operators. Since this will create a phenomenon known as ‘perfect competition’ – we expect prices to be significantly lower than of current VPN providers.",,Open Source Network allowing anyone to rent their unused Network traffic,Zug,Switzerland,,,Europe,Central Europe,2017,"Robertas Visinskis, Founder; Paulius Mozuras, Co-Founder, Smart Contract and Python developer; Valdas Petrulis, Co-Founder and Lead Software Engineer",start-up,https://twitter.com/MysteriumNet,https://www.facebook.com/MysteriumNet/,,,,https://mysterium.network/whitepaper.pdf,,,,,MYST,Public,Ethereum,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/mysterium/,,,,,,,,,,Robertas Visinskis,Robertas@mysterium.network,Paulius Mozuras,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

11,896.91 Australian Dollars (AUD) to 187 heads of households and 29 vendors, which was estimated to have directly benefited some
1,209 individuals in two urban communities in one of the world’s most at-risk countries.

Over the course of a month, Oxfam and its partners were able to successfully deliver a first-of-its-kind Distributed Ledger
Technology (DLT) based solution employing the Dai (DAI) stablecoin.1 Additionally, the system piloted in Vanuatu saw the successful
deployment of a novel near-field communication (NFC) card, which in tandem with a ‘side-channel’ developed by Sempo, allowed the
system to cope with poor internet connectivity while ensuring double-spends were impossible despite offline transactions.

Oxfam set out to determine whether DLTs can reduce the cost and transaction time of cash and voucher assistance (CVA), while improving
transparency, security, and overall user experience (UX) within the urban context of Port Vila, Republic of Vanuatu.

With the support of Sempo, the UnBlocked Cash pilot has shown modest cost-savings and significant time-savings related to
operational activities. Onboarding recipients to the platform was reduced to an average of 3.6 minutes per individual compared to
over an hour during the Ambae volcano response in 2018. Additionally, the tested system eliminated slow identity (ID) verifications
and reduced dependency on post offices or banks to deposit cheques.

However, there is little evidence that the direct time and cost of financial transaction between programme stakeholder accounts has been
reduced. This is due to the reliance on existing financial service providers (FSPs) for foreign exchange and cashing-out vendors in this
particular implementation. In contrast, the indirect time and cost appear to have fallen due to the efficacy gains promoted by the Sempo
platform. Fortunately, the unexpected challenges with the existing FSP in Vanuatu created an opportunity to test a more communityintegrated
hub-and-spoke cash-out mechanism via the ‘Super Vendor’ model.

The quality of the tested solution, which encompassed transparency, security, and user experience indicators, was found to be
extremely high. Recipient and vendor feedback alike indicates an overwhelming preference for assistance of this type.",,"Much faster, less expensive, and more transparent financial aid for relief efforts",,Vanuatu,,,Oceania,Oceania,2019,,partnership,,,https://medium.com/unblockedcash,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssa-ku22w0k,,,,https://consensys.net/blockchain-use-cases/social-impact/project-unblocked-cash-case-study/,,DAI,Private,Ethereum,,,"Oxfam,ConsenSys,MakerDAO,Semp,Australian Aid",,Asia,Southern Asia,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why 4p

Participate: Farmers proactively participate with our incentive system  instead of responding
Predict: In Sara Farm platform,  we can predict the total production based on the gathered data from farmers
Personalize: we customize the production based on the total collected data and individual farmers data and reward and motivate
Prevent:  Different from crop insurance, we take the preventive measure for crop price stability based on the data management and token economy

 As energy consumption is expected to double until 2030, the world is looking for new distributed energy development models to directly connect end users to producers, to allow consumers direct access to accountable, cheaper energy and to provide producers with increased ROI; enabling a faster renewable energy deployment around the world.
 
 Our solution is a new ecosystem - Restart Energy Democracy - one that exists inside the current legislation in deregulated energy markets and that provides incentives for consumers, producers. and local micro entrepreneurs, or even other private suppliers to participate.
 
 It's a system built on blockchain technology, that virtually connects energy consumers to energy producers (prosumers) with smart contracts, so that they may trade directly under our supply license or under a different private suppliers license.
 
 Allowing consumers to virtually buy energy directly from producers reduces transaction risk and payment collection costs for the suppliers, creates higher revenues and a finance solution for producers, and reduces the cost of energy for consumers, while at the same time offering entrepreneurs the possibility to start their own power retail business with our franchise.

Investment strategies and business models are increasingly built around maximizing a positive impact on the world. For this new economy to grow, we need to tie capital to results.

Raise is building a data-driven financial infrastructure for the growing impact economy with smart contracts and connected devices. Create automated investment milestones, track impact data and deploy capital globally.

How does Raise work?
Data
Devices are connected. Measure your impact with verifiable and data-driven metrics against international standards using connected devices.
Milestones
Use smart contracts to create transparent results-based financing where funds are disbursed when impact in the world is created and verified.
Blockchain
Transparency, trust, efficiency and cheaper financing transactions. Investing is expensive and paper-intensive, with the costs passed on to investors and entrepreneurs.

The company currently manages over $140m worth of energy on behalf of its large Industrial and Commercial customers. We look after approximately 1,100 customer sites across Europe, UK, France, Belgium & Netherlands. Customers include one of the largest law firms in the world, one of Europe’s largest fuel retailers and the UK’s largest independent construction materials group. We use Deep Learning Artifical Intelligence models in our core offering, to streamline the energy procurement process. Through this , customers have access to energy consumption insights like never seen before.
 
 Energi Mine aims to decentralize the $2 trillion global electricity markets which are naturally closed and controlled by a handful of large players. Energy companies are currently incentivised to sell more energy and at the highest possible price.
 
 The market for power (electricity) generation is naturally becoming decentralised, in that more and more individuals and businesses are generating their own energy through renewables. However, they are still selling this energy back to the big energy companies.
 
 Energi Mine is creating a platform that matches customers with smaller generators, as well as creating a global eco-system whereby users are rewarded with tokens (Energi Tokens – ETK) for energy-efficient behaviour.
 
 We believe that when it comes to energy, reward mechanisms must have a financial benefit to the user before behavioural change occurs. Therefore, we believe that the tokenisation of the market will be the only real driver to create a more energy-efficient system.
 
 For example, if a commuter is encouraged to use public transport by the Local City Authority, they could be rewarded by being given ETK. ETK then has a cash value, but could also be used to pay directly for the commuter’s domestic energy bill, or charge their EV.

Concrete Applications of Social Impact Bounties
The main goal behind social impact bounties — and why The Bounties Network is now part of the Blockchain for Social Impact Coalition (BSIC) — is to make collaboration cheaper, more seamless, and more transparent than existing social impact models. The BSIC focuses on developing and implementing blockchain products and solutions that can address social and environmental challenges across the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.

Instead, it leads to a bottom-up process of companies sharing and certifying their sustainable business practises in order to conquer new market segments and generate profit. This results in a chain reaction towards sustainability and company-initiated transparency.

Circularise is a blockchain-based communication protocol that allows traceability of process information in supply chains. It provides proof for information that is not obtainable by comparing two final products or materials, like the origin, labour conditions or the amount of recycled material in a product. This information is not accessible once the product has moved further in the production process. By tokenizing information at the stage where it occurs and trading this proof and information to the brand owner or customer, Circularise provides proof of invisible material properties. This occurs in a decentralised and safe way that does not put companies’ competitive advantage at risk. Circularise provides this information in supply chains that are even unknown to brand owners and opens the market to avoid oligopolies. It thereby provides more sustainable products and lower prices than before.

The technology abolishes any possibility for abuse by stakeholders of the supply chain and creates verifiable quality standards and new business models. The result is a paradigm shift from traceability and transparency as mandatory top-down regulation risking company secrets to a voluntary business decision for transparency on selected characteristics, bottom-up, unlocking additional monetary value which encourages others to join. The resulting increase in sustainability goals of companies leads to social practices being redefined as a necessity and quality criterion.",,Transparency and traceability for a circular economy,South Holland,Netherlands,,,Europe,Western Europe,2016,,start-up,https://twitter.com/Circularise,,https://www.linkedin.com/company/circularise/about/,,,,,,https://twitter.com/Circularise,,,Public,Ethereum,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is a digital identity blockchain application being used to replace an existing paper-based system to register children for a government funded pre-school subsidy in South Africa. Service providers use the mobile app to verify children’s attendance at classes and to capture other useful information. This will increase trust in the funding mechanism and make funding available to more children who need it. It will save administration time and costs..

The Cape Town organization, which is running a pilot with South African preschoolers, creates immutable digital identities to help children in Africa receive educational services and subsidies.

Project Amply strives to revolutionize early childhood development in Africa. Combining mobile and blockchain technology to increase impact and accountability of public services and generate real-time data.

OUR MISSION
Amply is a digital identity protocol that builds trust. We provide every child with their own self-sovereign digital identity based on the blockchain. This will enable children to receive benefits and services that they might have previously been excluded from.

In our pilot project, Amply is being used to replace an existing paper-based system to register children for a government funded pre-school subsidy in South Africa. Service providers use a mobile app to verify children’s attendance at classes and to capture other useful information. This will increase trust in the funding mechanism and make funding available to more children who need it. It will save administration time and costs. And it will provide really useful information about how and where services are being delivered.

Amply is unique in that it places each individual child at the centre of their relationships with Early Childhood Development services in a way that is ‘self-sovereign’ and directly beneficial to them. This means that a child’s digital identity and personal data are privately owned and controlled by the individual (with some help from their guardians). Over time, their life records become a rich source of data and value that can be used to receive services and insights that will become more predictive, precise, personalised, preventive, and participatory.

With consented access to personal data and identity assurance, entirely new classes of innovative applications can be developed for both local physical and distant virtual services. This is a big deal for growing a web of trust around children, to meet their developmental needs.

We use digital identities to
- gather real-time data and link it to sovereign identities
- increase efficiency and quality of public services for children
- create accountable blockchain based subsidies management platforms

As an improvement from the existing marketplace business in Singapore, the new MARKETPLACE 2.0 will allow anyone to source for energy from commercial energy suppliers or to buy directly from a private producer via ELECTRIFY’s peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform, SYNERGY.
 
 0% of the world’s population lives in Asia and almost half of this population live in cities; and they’re all connected to central power grids. Japan liberalised its power grid in 2016, China has done so in parts and Singapore will be the first in Southeast-Asia. As more countries liberalise their electricity markets, consumers will get greater choice in choosing their electricity retailers and the way they want to consume energy. 
 
 In these liberalised environments consumers still consume power from centralised grids managed by corporatised grid operators. There’s also fast growing demand for alternative energy resources like like solar panels, biomass and wind.
 
 However centralised electricity systems are lagging in innovations and alternatives. Solutions like renewable energy and peer-to-peer energy trading are still not prevalent. Without access to alternatives, consumers are not getting the choices they deserve.
 
 ELECTRIFY will enable the decentralisation of power production and bring the power of choice to the consumer. We aim to build a better electricity network, and it starts with an intelligent energy ecosystem.

They are excluded from better solutions due to high costs, lack of proper identity, poor access to banking locations, and mistrust or poor understanding of the banking system. Existing platforms have limited penetration due to lack of access to infrastructure like electricity, expensive access to Internet, insufficient capital to afford a smartphone, and a steep learning curve.

At Kora, we believe that technology should empower instead of displace existing communities and networks. 
 
The Kora Network is a blockchain built on four layers of infrastructure to provide a low cost financial services platform that is universally accessible via SMS/USSD on feature phones, or with internet access via mobile app, enabled by blockchain technology. This helps communities build and own self-sustaining financial services ecosystems. By drastically reducing the cost and time to provide financial services, and drawing a diverse set of stakeholders into an interoperable network, we unlock the Long Tail of the global economy. We aim to benefit the population most in need, enriching the global economy by unlocking the capital, intellect, and creativity of the underserved.

We are starting with four basic building blocks to construct a fully functional financial system. These building blocks are built into the Kora Network as smart contracts, and are accessible to any user on the network:

Identity: Letting a user prove they are who they are, and that they did what they say they did. Secure Storage: Letting a user protect their funds from being easily stolen or devalued. Money Transfer: Transferring value from one entity to another, quickly and securely. Marketplaces: Creating venues for users to exchange money for goods, services and capital.

“Financial services have been proven to help grow wealth. Unfortunately, for much of the world access is uneven and expensive. In many places formal banking is seen as something exclusively for the wealthy. Banks require high minimums and fees for opening and maintaining accounts. Due to the cost to serve and inability to prove identity, many financial institutions don’t open branches in remote or low-income areas, requiring people to travel for hours to transfer money.”

THE ISSUE
It’s a fact, corals are going extinct : half of the worldwide coral reefs has disappeared in the last 30 years. Yet, they host 25% of marine biodiversity and more than 850 millions of humans depend on them. We can contribute to coral reefs restoration by planting new corals but this solution suffers from a lack of visibility and investment.

OUR SOLUTION
One of the greatest technology of our time is blockchain. It offers great capabilities in terms of traceability, digital ownership and new economic models. Our goal is to leverage blockchain technology to create a green economy to support environmental causes.

IN DETAILS
On our platform you will discover virtual corals, called « cryptocorals » that you can own. This mean you become the owner of a « crypto- asset » created on the blockchain.
Each cryptocoral finance the plantation of a real coral, by one of our partner NGOs. Cryptocorals are unique and each one of them has an economic value. They can evolve on the platform, multiply themselves and be sold on the marketplace.

OUR VISION
We believe in finding and implementing creative ways to save the planet. New social and business models have to emerged in order to create a positive economy. With CryptoCorals we want to demonstrate that technology can be leveraged for causes that matter in totally unexpected ways.

TEAM
We are a team of engineers, designers, business people, who want to contribute to our planet preservation. The team is hosted in the « French Bureau startup studio » in Paris. We already have two partners ready to plant corals : the CRIOBE in Moorea and Coral Guardian.

The complexity of today's electricity systems increases with the addition of distributed energy generation and storage, with regards to the integration of these cheap, clean technologies into the existing grid. This complexity leads to a lack of transparency, with a plenty of room for accounting errors that can range from honest mistakes to outright fraud.
 
The answer to this challenge must be based on a truly smart grid which will be able to optimize the complex energy flows and will rely on transparent real-time energy data for its operation. In such a smart grid the value of distributed generation and storage can be recognized and hence, rewarded.
 
SOLUTION/PRODUCT:
i) Pylon Network's blockchain algorithm is the first decentralized, open-source code designed specifically for the needs of the energy sector.
ii) Pylon's core code is integrated into smart energy meters (METRON), which are now able to perform instantaneous payments for electricity transactions through Pylon Network's payment method – automated, secure and without intermediaries.
 iii) P2P transactions on the blockchain through METRONs offer the opportunity of tracing (and choosing) exactly when and where your electricity comes from – by certifying the origin and cost of electricity to the consumers.
 iv) The decentralization and high granularity of the energy data offers the transparency and trust among all the energy players and can hence play the role of a cooperation platform – a shared, transparent database on which value can be traced and hence, fairly rewarded.
 v) The open source license ensures that its access remains open and that anyone can use the blockchain code to develop and integrate their existing smart meters – or any other energy tool (charging stations, energy datahubs etc.) – into Pylon Network.
 Blockchain:The development of a blockchain code designed specifically for the energy sector, with the integration of different technologies from the field of blockchain, (atomic swap, lighting network ..) – is what really makes this platform unique. Compared to competitors, Pylon Network addresses the specific (and loud) problems of the energy market as well as those that are blockchain-related – namely, security, scalability and energy/carbon footprint.
 
In our opinion, the competition fails to deal effectively with these constraints and peculiarities of the energy markets and the blockchain technology. The most typical example (which has recently received a lot of criticism) is the energy consumption associated with Bitcoin- or Ethereum-based algorithms, on which all our competitors rely on, for building green energy platforms – ironically.
 
COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES:
**Energy Traceability ** – Know -at any moment – where your electricity came from and where your money went to!
* * Hardware Integration** – With METRON smart meters installed at the consumer/prosumer level.
* * Unlock the smart grid** – Real-time, decentralized energy database.
* * Open Source license** – Fast and cooperative development. Flexibility, connectivity, and adaptability.
* * Environmentally friendly algorithm** (""Green Mining"") – Decentralized security and trust with the development of a mining algorithm with minimal energy demands and carbon footprint.

We're tackling what we believe are the biggest systemic problems that the sector faces - problems including slow and reactive funding, centralised decision-making, and an aversion to change, means that people affected by crises around the world, do not receive the best help fast enough, and needless suffering results.

We are aiming to catalyse change in three ways:

- Shifting humanitarian financing from a reactive to a proactive model
- Creating a more balanced system that shifts power and decision-making to those closest to the frontline
- Facilitating collective innovation to solve humanitarian problems locally and globally

Start Network was born in 2010. Sparked from informal conversations between humanitarian leaders from aid agencies who were frustrated by the challenges they faced. Governments were struggling to adapt quickly enough to tackle global problems, such as climate change, and increasingly violent conflict, which were driving ever larger numbers of people to flee from their homes.

In 2017 Start Network formed a partnership with a start-up social enterprise Disberse to push forward our plan to test blockchain in the delivery of humanitarian finance. Using the Disberse platform, we set out to test blockchain in a series of small disbursements. The pilot involved the creation of digital wallets on the blockchain that donors could use the transfer funding to NGOs, the NGO could then use its digital wallet to transfer the funding onto country teams.

for an Internet free from surveillance and censorship","Orchid Labs Inc. is an open-source project committed to ending surveillance and censorship on the internet. The founders and I had been thinking: why can’t we build an Internet that no one can shut down, so that everyone can use it without fear? To do that, the concept of decentralizing everything made sense, because there’s no single point of failure. The Orchid protocol uses an overlay network built upon the existing internet, which is driven by a peer-to-peer tokenized bandwidth exchange, creating a more inclusive, liberated internet.

Orchid is the realization of many decades of work to use technology and entrepreneurship for social betterment. Token offerings are not for get-rich schemes nor are they a way to raise money when you’ve been rejected by every venture capitalist in town. But they can be a driver for technology that creates change. With Orchid, we’re building a new Internet, one that aims to restore to the internet to a place open and accessible to all, where communication and collaboration may flow freely.

THE ORCHID PROTOCOL
OUR MISSION
The Internet was invented for everyone. An open platform to access information, collaborate, and communicate freely across borders. Unfortunately, it’s no longer a place of true openness and freedom. But, we can change that. We’ve created an open-source protocol with a token-based bandwidth exchange to protect everyone around the world from censorship and surveillance.

WHY
Internet access for over 75% of the global population is restricted or censored. ISPs worldwide harvest and sell users’ data to the highest bidder. Orchid is a new surveillance-free layer on top of the existing Internet, allowing users to bypass firewalls, access information, and communicate freely. Join us and help create a truly independent, censorship-free Internet.

ALL THE RIGHT PARTS
Orchid combines its protocol with surplus bandwidth, state-of-the art-encryption, and a decentralized infrastructure to bring users surveillance-free access to the existing Internet. Because everyone is surveilled and bandwidth is ubiquitous, Orchid users can exchange bandwidth in peer-to-peer transactions using Orchid tokens on the Ethereum blockchain.

FAQs
ABOUT ORCHID
 What is Orchid?
Orchid is an open-source project committed to ending surveillance and censorship on the Internet. The Orchid protocol uses an overlay network built upon the existing Internet, which is driven by a peer-to-peer tokenized bandwidth exchange, creating a more inclusive, liberated Internet. Orchid Labs Inc. is a delaware company with the mission of promoting and supporting the research and development of the Orchid Protocol. Orchid Labs Inc. was founded in 2017 by leading technologists and is headquartered in San Francisco, California.

 What is the purpose of Orchid?
To make the Internet free of surveillance and censorship again.

 How does it work?
The Orchid Protocol is an open-source overlay network that runs on top of the Internet. Its fully decentralized, because rather than traffic being routed through central authorities—your ISP or your VPN—it’s instead routed randomly through a network of bandwidth contributors who sign up to share their surplus bandwidth and activate their Internet-connected device as a 'node'”Users that want to access an uncensored Internet (bandwidth consumers) pay the bandwidth contributors in Orchid tokens through a peer-to-peer exchange. Because neither the traffic nor the payments can be monitored by central authorities, both contributors and consumers of bandwidth enjoy a fully anonymous, surveillance-free experience.

 When will it go live?
Orchid protocols are available in private alpha to select recipients today. Later this year, all Orchid software will be published to the open source community. Early in 2018 we plan to offer a public beta of the Orchid Protocol to help billions of users on all corners of the globe make Internet Freedom a reality.

 Who are the investors?
To support Orchid Labs and its mission, the company has raised $4.7M seed SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens) from investors including Sequoia, Andreessen Horowitz, DFJ, PolyChain Capital, Metastable, Blockchain Capital, Crunchfund, Struck Capital, Compound VC, and several other funds and angel investors.",,A world where users own the Internet,San Francisco,United States,,,North America,North America,2017,Brian J.Fox; Gustav Simonsson; Jay Freeman; Stephen Bell; Steven (Seven) Waterhouse,start-up,https://twitter.com/orchidprotocol,https://www.facebook.com/OrchidProtocol/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/orchid-labs/about/,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffulU3DF5Fw,https://www.orchid.com/whitepaper/english.pdf,,,https://medium.com/@stevewaterhouse/supporting-a-decentralized-uncensored-internet-for-every-person-on-the-planet-5881c93be4fb,,OCT,Public,Ethereum,https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/orchid/,,,Global,Global,Global,,,ir@orchid.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Less than 7 percent out of a 21 million population in Sri Lanka has any form of insurance (accident, life, health, property or agriculture). The figures go well under one digit in the agriculture sector, where only 11,000 farmers are covered even though the sector employs around a third of the workforce and accounts for almost 20 percent of the economy, according to official data.

With this conditions, Sri Lanka is a perfect candidate to feel the benefits of decentralized, collaborative and automated insurance, especially in the farming sector, where hundreds of thousands of small producers are increasingly exposed to climate change risks.

Cooperation and result-oriented innovation
The partnership, announced at the “Blockchain for Social Good” event in London by Etheric’s Inclusive Insurance leader Michiel Berende, is an example of multidisciplinary cooperation to address complex real-world problems. Oxfam provides the first-hand experience in the farmer-community, Aon lends its knowledge in the (re)insurance market and in developing insurance propositions, while Etherisc brings its blockchain and decentralized risk-pools expertise.

The project background is also an interesting case of how blockchain can be used to improve current processes and avoid having to start building solutions from scratch. We believe the disruption is in the results, not in the players, the tech or the process.

In this case, blockchain has a great potential for enabling insurance for smallholder farmers, a largely untapped niche because of its great challenges, from accessing remotes farmers areas with no banking access to deal with costly red tape and liquidity constraints.

Improving trust and efficiency
Oxfam has been successfully working with the private sector on agricultural weather index insurance in Sri Lanka for farming communities at risk of losing crops due to extreme weather. The project with Etherisc and Aon aims to build on the current system with a blockchain-based process workflow to create efficiencies, develop trust across the value chain and deliver a scalable platform to support a larger insured base.

Using a weather data index as a trigger for smart contracts, we can automate a lot of cumbersome tasks in the laborious insurance claim process, making the compensation process more effective and affordable. This is especially relevant when working with insurance for smallholder farmers, as sometimes the cost of processing a claim can sometimes surpass the claimed amount.

“We are looking at how blockchain can lower costs and increase efficiencies and make it easier for many more farmers to get access to this product,“ Michiel Berende said.
Empowering human possibility
During the following months, we will be assessing the existing setup and working alongside Oxfam with a group of 3,000 farmers to show how our technology can improve the current process insurance products.

The partnership common goal is to design a completely automated weather index insurance product that should provide low-cost agriculture insurance, with a higher percentage of premiums being used for claims payment and immediate pay-out.

In the longer term, we hope will be able to impact as many as 800,000 farmers in Sri Lanka and expand our experience to other countries.

In the words of our Aon partner in a statement:

“By bringing micro-insurance, with very small premiums, to the hard working paddy field rice farmers, we are empowering economic and human possibility.”",,Decentralized Insurance Protocol,,Sri Lanka,,,Asia,Southern Asia,2018,,partnership,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ethereum,,,"Etherisc,Aon,Oxfam",Sri Lanka,Asia,,,,baidya.arindom@gmail.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

BTMs create secure interoperability between disparate global financial networks, mobile network carriers and emerging blockchains, enabling frictionless exchange of value between those networks.

The journey began In 2012, when our team of Harvard and Stanford graduates came together to launch a P2P Cash Incubator to develop global Financial Technology applications. Our primary goal is to improve the financial well-being of the 2 billion under-banked people in the world through the use of blockchain. 

We invented BitMinutes (BTM), a new crypto-currency that is based on International (ISO) Banking Standards and that which not only provides secure liquidity for P2P lenders but also democratizes P2P lending to denominations as small as $10. Their inter-changeability between prepaid minutes and cash collateralizes even the smallest P2P loan.

Most ICOs can be risky as the they typically raise capital for incomplete projects that do not address a proven consumer market. BitMinutes are in continuous production, targeting the combined global remittance and mobile prepaid industries market valued at $1.2 trillion. Today we have a global distribution in place reaching over 4 billion mobile phones and over 2 billion bank accounts. BitMinutes use builds both consumer credit and acts as a collateral for lending. 

We have signed on MasterCard as one of our global partners, issuing virtual accounts based on BitMinutes. Currently we are under negotiation with a global multi-carrier reaching over half a billion subscribers.

We are a community focused on making the world a better place through the use of blockchain technology. Our flagship product, the Giveth Donation Application (DApp) brings accountability and transparency to the donation space.The Giveth system enables accountability on chain & off! Every person that touches your donation has an open line of communication where you two can connect. The goal is to build a community around a cause; so non-monetary resources can be shares as well.

Giveth uses the smart contract technology (Ethereum) allowing the process of donation giving to be fully transparent and embracing social accountability. 

The Donation Application (DApp)
Giveth is re-engineering charitable giving, by creating an entirely free, open-source platform, built on the Ethereum Blockchain. Our system cuts out bureaucracy and enables nonprofits to create a high level of transparency and accountability towards Givers. At any point until the moment funds are locked, a Giver can decide to withdraw them. 

A Decentralized Altruistic Community
(DAC)
Giving to a cause can be just the beginning of your involvement. At Giveth we strongly believe in the power of communities to change the world. We are building our software to encourage Givers and Makers to connect as well as discover a decentralized governance model that works for them. We are actively practicing what we preach as we model what it is to be the first DAC. 

We hope to help projects use our modular system to test their innovative smart contracts and UIs with real money in a low risk environment. Imagine starting a charity to help alleviate homelessness in your hometown while alpha testing an experimental decentralized governance system you plan to use in your project. 

With Giveth, you can have live smart contract testing while making the world a better place! And because of Giveth's open-source nature, if a decentralized governance protocol or any other smart contract is used on the platform successfully it can easily achieve network effect and be utilized by other DACs (Decentralized Altruistic Communities) to aid in their cause.

This allowed for the recording and authentification of transfers for 10,000 people.

Completed on 31st May 217, the project run by the United Nation's World Food Programme (WFP) was designed to direct resources to thousands of Syrian refugees by giving them cryptocurrency-based vouchers that could be redeemed in participating markets.

The future of world food aid arrived, in early May, unnoticed by its first recipients: the grocery shoppers inside a supermarket at the Azraq camp in Jordan, home to 36,000 Syrian refugees. To be fair, their buying process already looked pretty high-tech, especially for a store with a dirt parking lot in the middle of the desert. Before paying, each shopper peered into a black, rectangular iris scanner mounted at eye level, which confirms users’ identities with the camp’s organizing group, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, and allows them to access a food stipend from the United Nations’ World Food Programme (WFP).

That’s a spiffy authentication process, but it had been there for months. What the shoppers didn’t see was the new back-end procedure. Instead of receiving WFP funds via a third party, such as a bank, the grocery store was reconciling each purchase directly with the aid group through a secure platform called Building Blocks, based on blockchain technology. Inside the store, Houman Haddad, a finance officer for the WFP and the founder of Building Blocks, watched as each eye scan led to a cashier’s tablet flashing a green check mark, signaling a completed transaction. “It was the moment when I knew this was technically possible,” he says.

Haddad, in the meantime, is building up internal support to expand the Building Blocks project. He has organized a blockchain steering committee at the WFP, and he’s drawing up plans for further expansion. By the second quarter of next year, the system could cover the entire Syrian refugee population of Jordan, or 500,000 people, which would include people who don’t live in camps. He’s hopeful he’ll make a connection in Cancún that will see more organizations join the WFP’ blockchain effort. “I wish that somehow we would get somebody to accept our hand and shake it from the other end,” he says.",,Blockchain for Zero Hunger,Rome,Italy,,,Europe,Southern Europe,2017,Houman Hassad,Private-Public-Partnership,,,,,,,,,"http://innovation.wfp.org/project/building-blocks

AliceSi uses the Ethereum blockchain to help charities raise more donations by being radically transparent about their impact.
Organizations can raise funds based on impact transparency – funds are released once an independent party can validate outcomes.

Transparent donations
Alice’s first live application creates trust by showing donors exactly what impact their money makes. It also automatically gives projects more if they achieve their goals.

Impact management
Alice decentralises the evaluation, monitoring and reporting of impact. This reduces administrative costs while making it easier to compare and benchmark projects.

Impact investing
Alice dramatically reduces transaction costs for impact investors, thanks to cheap & reliable due diligence, automated payments and a native secondary market.

Grants DAO
Part of Alice's revenue is redistributed as grants to help social organisations launch high quality projects on the platform. Users vote to decide how.

Transparent appeals

Our platform will provide incentive for donors to ""give smart."" Historically, charitable giving has been centralized, which results in administrative inefficiencies and intermediary burdens in fulfilling nonprofit missions. With blockchain technology, transparency, immutability, peer to peer value transfer, and decentralization, will phenomenally assist charitable giving, across global lines. Our token will be used to fund charitable causes, domestically and internationally. The blockchain will create end to end audit trail, that anyone can verify, to see where the donation truly went. Also, our platform is surrounded by an ecosystem, that ensures optimal stability.

About DestiNeed
Nonprofits are worth almost a trillion dollars to the U.S. Economy and constantly growing.

Yet, the fact remains, it is very burdensome to run a charitable organization. Data management, expensive internal oversight, and a less than desirable donor pool, can each undercut the nonprofit mission tremendously.

Unfortunately, nonprofits sometimes have a difficult time realizing their purpose and objectives. Historically, in accomplishing its mission, money has been the greatest challenge for nonprofits to overcome. With  blockchain technology, we know this can rapidly change. Ethereum based
smart contracts have an inherent ability to revolutionize the way nonprofits are funded.

Additionally, our platform seeks to continuously reward our donors to keep our community active, thriving, collaborative, efficient, and ideal among any competitors.

Blockchain is the PRESENT future of the sharing economy, and we invite you to be part of this monumental change.

Mission

DestiNeed will be an open smart contract based exchange, facilitating the space where decentralized and trustless transactions can take place, for the benefit of the social sector. DestiNeed also aims to encourage donors to use DSN to fund nonprofits, so our objective further includes supporting each of our donors, so they are recognized, and ultimately rewarded for their charitable giving.

IrisGuard products & services revolves around iris recognition research and development, iris camera engineering, design and manufacturing of worldwide commercialization of iris end-to-end identity solutions.

In 2017, the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR) has used IrisGuard’s private Ethereum blockchain technology to enable streamlined payment services for thousands of Syrian refugees seeking humanitarian aid, according to a report by ETH News.

IrisGuard’s EyePay system has already serviced over 10,000 refugees in Jordan using iris recognition technology (IRT), which allows for food purchases to be settled on the blockchain.

The blockchain’s robust encryption system ensures that all transactions are secured and are executed without using a card, pin, username, password, ID, or mobile device.

As a result, the platform is ideal for non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and aid organizations, as the IRT eliminates any logistical and monetary barriers related to integrating card and smartphone issuance for every refugee.

The system also removes the possibility of fraudulent transactions and embezzlement of funds.

“The UNHCR has achieved financial inclusion for unbanked refugees and enabled them to efficiently receive international donor cash assistance directly on unattended bank ATM’s and food at checkout counters in supermarkets and nonfood items in camps; all while refugees are either unable or not allowed to open a bank account by law,” IrisGuard said in a statement.

Over the past few years, several aid programs have been investigated by governments who have focused on providing humanitarian aid to Syrian refugees.

The United States Government Accountability Office (GOA) released a report last year that stated that US agencies could improve on fraud oversight.

It will be an unique way to invest in companies, projects and new technologies for clean energy production. Several years ago we started our work based on the vision to produce energy from renewable sources only.
 
 Our motivation is: Even a vehicle with environmental friendly fuel cell and hydrogen as fuel is not clean, if used hydrogen is produced by fossil sources.
 
 One and the most famous supported project is HydroGenial. In this project a method called Absorbtion Enhanced Reforming (AER) is used to reform organic crop into a synthetic gas, from which high grade Substitute Natural Gas (SNG) and later Hydrogen (H2) will be extracted.
 
 Hydrogen energy industry is still in the early beginning. For example: Only few hydrogen gasstations exist in Germany. In near future there will be hundreds and thousands.
 
 Besides our research and development work for adequate production technologies, project scheduling and others, suddenly some successfull Initial Coin Offerings (ICO) appear in the marketplace and we were very excited about these new form of crowdfunding. Some team members were experienced a lot with cryptocurrencies, especially with Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH). We put all our knowledge together and idea of HydroCoin was born.
 
 According to our concept, HydroCoin is not only a tradeable value, it is also a certificate and a customer payment solution for fuel at gasstations. In future the owner of HydroCoin will be the Hydrogen Future Foundation. Members will vote for projects to support.
 
 Earliest trading day for HydroCoin will be October 1st 2018. The price of HydroCoin will depend on market activity, availability of clean energy and willingness of customers to buy those.

EXERGY Platform
LO3Energy announced in 2017 the launch of its patented blockchain software and transactive energy system that will revolutionize the energy industry. Exergy (a term that is also used in reference to useful energy during transmission) is used here to refer to a distributed ledger that functions on grid-connected hardware, a token system for transactive energy and a foundation that advances market design and technology in tandem. Exergy generates, controls and secures the data required to enable price as a proxy for control and optimal operation of electric power systems.
“We are leading an energy revolution,” said Lawrence Orsini, founder and CEO of LO3 Energy. “Reimagining how we generate, consume, and transact energy. Uncovering data that will transform markets and reward consumers with better energy services, using our existing grid and adding new infrastructure where it is needed most.”
LO3 Energy’s current blockchain system is continuing to evolve as it works in the US and Australia. The block chain will be running in Germany by year end.
Four components make up the Exergy system:

• XRG Token: The Exergy token system activates the transactive energy services to be developed and adopted faster at the
grid edge.
• TAG-e Technology: Our proprietary meter is a hybrid device with both an electric meter and a computer. It collectively
manages energy by measuring a building’s energy production and consumption.
• Mobile App: A customer-facing interface where units of electricity are bought and sold instantaneously at a local level on
your computer or mobile device.
• Foundation: Advancing technology and policy for transactive energy by initiating research, advocating for improved
regulatory frameworks, and investing in early-stage projects to advance the Exergy System.

The block chain component of Exergy is working in the US and Australia, with two German projects expected to be online by end of year.

SolarCoin, a blockchain-based digital asset and currency, is designed to accelerate the transition to a clean energy economy. As a blockchain based technology, SolarCoin is global and decentralized, with similarities to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. SolarCoin stands out, because unlike these, SolarCoin ‘binds’ the disbursement of digital coins to useful economic and environmental activity - verifiably produced solar energy.
 
 SolarCoin uses the unique characteristics of blockchain technology to create a phenomenon that is:
 1. a free, additional reward for solar energy producers
 2. the first digital currency to protect natural capital
 3. the first global, decentralized, non-governmental solar energy incentive program
 
 The SolarCoin Foundation rewards solar energy producers with blockchain-based digital tokens at the rate of 1 SolarCoin (SLR) per 1 MWh of solar energy produced. 
 
 §1 SolarCoin represents 1 MWh of solar electricity generation. 
 As a verified solar electricity producer, you may get SolarCoins for free. 
 99% of SolarCoins will be given to solar electricity producers of 97,500 TWh over 40 yrs.
 
 The SolarCoin Foundation
 SolarCoin was created in 2014 as an open community project run by volunteers and the founders of the SolarCoin Foundation, a Delaware (U.S.A) registered Public Benefit Corporation.
 
 The SolarCoin Foundation distributes SolarCoins to generators of solar electricity using verified olar facilities as the “proof-of-work”. As opposed to Bitcoin, SolarCoin is granted for the proof of energy production from the the solar installation. SolarCoin’s blockchain uses a low energy proof of stake algorithm designed to use less than 0.001% of the power of bitcoin when compared on similar scale. The SolarCoin blockchain itself is a public ledger detailing each SolarCoin given out to solar electricity generators.
 
 Foundation. SolarCoin Affiliates, Advisors, and Volunteers
 The SolarCoin Foundation works closely with affiliates who help to verify SolarCoin claims information. Affiliates are usually organized as for-profit companies, whose services significantly contribute to building the SolarCoin Ecosystem. Affiliates usually receive SolarCoins from the SolarCoin Foundation for each claim they verify and facilitate for claimants from a separate pool reserved for these services by the SolarCoin Foundation.
 
 Current SolarCoin Affiliates are:
 - Solcrypto - www.solcrypto.com
 - ElectriCChain - www.electricchain.org
 
 The following is a non-exhaustive list of use-cases for SolarCoin as a reward/ incentive-mechanism and/or through the Blockchain data layer:
 
 1. SolarCoins can be exchanged through online exchanges such as Bittrex and Lykke
 (www.bittrex.com; www.lykke.com) for other digital assets (such as Bitcoin) and/or fiat
 currencies (EUR, USD…)
 
 2. SolarCoins are starting to be accepted for payments, like other digital currencies. The SolarCoin community is aiming for an integration of SolarCoin as a payment network for goods and services.
 
 3. SolarCoin offers marketing opportunities for brands positioned on ecological values and environmental protection. Early adopters and first movers are expressing the wish to use SolarCoins for payments, be it in environmental conscious contexts (organic food etc.), energy sector or NGOs.
 
 4. SolarCoins can be used as a reward for customers and could be used as a loyalty program to allow them to benefit from the appreciation of the coins.
 
 5. SolarCoins could be developed further to serve as equivalent of avoided CO2-emission certificates. With the Paris Agreement and international action to mitigate climate change at hand, SolarCoins could play a role in a revived carbon trade system via crypto carbon credits.
 
 6. The SolarCoin blockchain can be used as a trusted data layer reporting solar power
 production data. Such data layer could certify solar components. This has been
 demonstrated by some companies to certify solar power plant due-diligence reports inside the immutable SolarCoin blockchain. 
 
 7. The SolarCoin blockchain can provide a “Know-Your-Device” (KYD) anchor data provenance layer for providing more security when monitoring solar power produced.
 
 8. The SolarCoin blockchain is an Open-Community data resource. Anyone may publish solar energy data, a Global Solar Macroscope may act as a decentralized solar energy monitoring platform. This can have two levels of data, on-chain public data, and off-chain private login data for each specific solar plant added into the decentralized monitoring protocol. Some open data can be used at specific intervals for solar power production data according to geographic region, taxes (when billed in SolarCoin) and financial tools (solar energy derivatives and exchange platforms). Some closed or private data can be extended to point to off-chain logins for specific internet layer solar monitoring platforms such as
 Wattmon.live, Enphase and others.


_________________

SolarCoin was developed with blockchain technology to generate an additional reward for solar electricity producers. Solar installation owners registering to the SolarCoin network receive one SolarCoin for each MWh of solar electricity that they produce.

This Digital Asset will allow solar electricity producers to receive an additional reward for their contribution to the energy transition, which will develop itself through network effect. SolarCoin is freely distributed to any owner of a solar installation owner. Participating in the SolarCoin program can be done online, directly on the SolarCoin website. More than 1.700.000MWh of solar energy have been incentivized through SolarCoin across 44 countries.

The SolarCoin Foundation is established in Greenwich CT and has on its board Financial experts as well as solar experts and is a member of the European Solar Association, SolarPowerEurope, based out of Brussels.

SolarCoin is the first digital asset to be recognized at supra-national level by the International Renewable Energy Association as a tool to finance solar installations worldwide (IRENA) and SolarCoin is being listed on a Swiss Exchange, www.lykke.com for online SLR-EUR and SLR-USD trade.

The SolarCoin reward tool will act as an incentivizer for solar owners working with the ElectraSeed kits. Instead of the normal 1SLR per MWh of solar energy incentivization, the tool will be rewarding owners with a multiplicating factor, hence 250kWh of solar energy will deliver one SolarCoin, the goal being to help solar owners amortize their financial investment faster.",,"A blockchain-based solar energy

The partnership will allow Dash customers to pay for their mobile recharge phone, monthly bills, and vouchers for prepaid mobile services, as well as the gaming platform Steam, through Bitrefill’s platform. Bitrefill, which currently supports Bitcoin and Litecoin as forms of payment, indicated strong demand from customers to integrate Dash due to its low fees, and near instant transaction speeds.

“Dash’s ability to transact at near Visa like speeds with our InstantSend feature, as well as enable double-spend protected transactions, make it ideal for commerce partners like Bitrefill,” stated Dash Director of Global Business Bradley Zastrow. “We offer a solution that eliminates fraud while also providing an extremely fast form of payment, critical to the user experience. As a bonus, Dash will soon be offering a 10% discount when buying either phone or Steam vouchers using Dash through Bitrefill’s platform.”

Both Dash and Bitrefill share a similar mission to help service the underbanked and unbanked across the globe. As a result, both companies currently boast significant, overlapping customer bases in several countries- such as Venezuela, Chile, and Zimbabwe- that are plagued by the effects of hyperinflation and insufficient financial services such as digital payments providers. The new partnership will help both companies continue their expansion in these critical markets, offering cheaper, more efficient alternative payment methods to users.

“We service underbanked communities around the world, and Dash’s InstantSend transactions and low fees will further help these communities,” explained Bitrefill CEO Sergej Kotliar. “We look forward to working with the Dash community to make paying for prepaid mobile phones more affordable and efficient.”

Crowdfund Insider asked both platforms about Goldman Sachs Global Head of Investment Research Steven Strongin’s biting appraisal of the token and digital currency emerging market:

“I agree with the Goldman Sachs’ report in that many of today’s cryptocurrencies will cease to exist at some point in the future,” responded Dash Director of Global Business, Bradley Zastrow via email. “There are too many coins that have a hyper specific purpose, some without even solid projects or roadmaps. To that extent, we probably are in a bubble at the industry level, but like the Goldman Sachs’ report pointed out, there will be clear winners. In my view, it’s the coins who a) solve a specific problem, b) have a strong governance structure and c) have a sustainable funding model which allows for proactive growth, like Dash, who will be the survivors.”

Sergej Kotliar, Bitrefill CEO, concurred, also via email,

“I agree with the sentiment. There is currently a lot of hype in the field, overblown expectations and inflated valuations. That said, I am incredibly bullish on cryptocurrencies as a long-term invention, and upcoming technologies such as payment channels (Lightning networks), that will let cryptocurrencies fulfill the original promise of being ‘instant and cheap,’ while also maintaining a high level of decentralization.”",,,,,,,#N/A,#N/A,2018,,partnership,,,,,,,,,https://www.dash.org/forum/threads/dash-to-bank-the-unbanked.12743/,,DASH,,Dash,,,,,,,,,support@bitrefill.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Our vision is to build a world in which any person, regardless of their draw in the lottery of life, can realise their full potential.","Many talented students in low-income countries lack the economic means to realise their potential, but philanthropists hesitate to donate. The impact of their funds is unclear, but attaching conditionality to ensure that funds are used for its intended purpose is costly. Administrative costs are also high due to high transfer costs and the need for having several middlemen. DirectEd solve these problems by combining the power of decentralised identities and blockchain technology to provide a transparent, secure, and low-cost means of making conditional peer-to-peer donations directly to students.

This is a description of the process flow in chronological order, from DirectEd identifying relevant high schools, to students receiving scholarships.

1. DirectEd identifies high schools in low-income areas. In Ethiopia, these schools have been onboarded  to the Atala PRISM decentralised identifier system. In Kenya, we help schools become issuers of verifiable credentials. We link those DIDs to Cardano wallets, preparing the students to receive scholarships. 
2. DirectEd specifies a smart contract for each high school. The smart contracts do three things: (a) specify the threshold for scholarship eligibility, (b) randomly choose scholarship winners amongst eligible students, and (c) specify conditions for scholarship disbursement.
3. Donors pledge donation amounts to one of many smart contracts, each representing a high school. Initially, only ADA donations will be supported, but over time other currencies will be accepted as well, starting with stable coins, then other crypto currencies, and lastly fiat currencies. Donors receive an NFT minted by DirectEd, that can be used to prove that they have donated and unlock access to a progress tracking page for the specific cohort they donated to.
4. High schools issue credentials, containing grades, to decentralise identifiers (DIDs) belonging to students. The students can then apply for a relevant scholarship through an oracle solution.
5. Once the scholarship application window is closed, a lottery amongst eligible students decides the scholarship winners. 
6. Students register at university and the registrar issues a credential to the student’s DID. Students share their proof of registration to the smart contract, which triggers the next scholarship disbursement. 
7. Further disbursements are similarly conditioned on evidence of successful progress as evidenced by verifiable credentials issued by the univesity. 
8. If scholarship students fail to satisfy some of the conditions within the pre-specified time frame written in the smart contract, whatever remaining funds is returned to the donor address.",,,Oxford,United Kingdom,,,Europe,Western Europe,2021,,non-profit,https://twitter.com/DirectEdDev,,,,,,,,,,,Public,"Cardano, Atala PRISM, hyperledger indy",,,,"Kenya, Ethiopia, United Kingdom, Sweden, Denmark",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

","BlockID is enabling people and companies to escape from the legacy systems of paper-based documents and move into a true digital identity with unprecedented privacy, security, transparency and individual rights by leveraging the power of blockchain technology.

In today’s $4 trillion digital economy where money can be sent across the world in milliseconds and everything from buying food to submitting a job application has moved online, simply proving who you are to those who genuinely need to know has remained stubbornly rooted in the legacy age of paper.

Try opening a bank account, applying for a government service or even buying a SIM card for a mobile device, and you’ll need to provide a physical ID such as a driver’s license that’s then scanned or photocopied to satisfy regulatory requirements. The online world is even more chaotic. The average person has over 50 digital identities, each stored by a different company or government organization in siloed identity management (IDM) systems. Security protections range from strong to barely existent.

Maintaining valid information across these multiple stores can be challenging for individuals and companies alike. Worse still, users have little or no control over their own digital identity information.

BlockID by 1Kosmos is the answer to these challenges. It’s a revolutionary new technology that enables users to store their identity data in a secure digital identity safe on their own mobile devices, and provide it easily to those who need to access and validate it.",,"Identity is your RIGHT, and not a priviledge",Somerset,United States,,,North America,North America,2017,Rohan Pinto – CTO,start-up,https://twitter.com/BCIdentity,https://facebook.com/BlockChainIdentity,,,http://youtube.com/c/BlockChainIdentity,https://onekosmos.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/1Kosmos_BlockID_OnePager.pdf,,,"https://onekosmos.com/blog/

TruBudget is a software that uses a distributed ledger to give donors and governments access to records of budgetary spending on schools and hospitals from the point of disbursement to subsequent transactions, such as procurement, contracting and implementation of a given project.

“One of the biggest obstacles to economic development is the mismanagement of public funding. It also jeopardises the effectiveness of financial cooperation on a regular basis,” said Dr Norbert Kloppenburg, member of the executive board of KfW.

The pilot programme has received €1 million from the Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), the German ministry that oversees KfW. The development bank’s digital department is responsible for developing the underlying software meanwhile, which is expected to be tested again after an initial six-to-eight month trial in Zambia.

Dr Zakotnik said TruBudget could be used to address the loss of billions each year from African economies due to mismanaged tax revenues, though the software would be used primarily to protect public sector investment in development projects.",,A blockchain-based tool for transparent budget management in development cooperation,Frankfurt,Germany,,,Europe,Central Europe,2017,,government,,,,,,,,,https://www.devfinance.net/blockchain-track-public-spending-africa/,,,,"Bitcoin,Multichain",,,KfW,Zambia,Africa,,,"lucas knows 2 persons involved at KfW, Ronald as well",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The company leverages the decentralised and democratic crypto-economy to make solar power and its economic, social and environmental benefits more accessible and inclusive. Through the Sun Exchange online platform, anyone with an internet connection can purchase solar photovoltaic cells, and lease them to businesses, hospitals, schools and other organisations located in the sunniest regions of the planet. Solar cell owners receive lease rental payments , paid optionally in fiat or bitcoin , while offtakers enjoy the benefits of affordable clean energy.

Solar cells purchased through Sun Exchange provide an unique opportunity to earn income while helping to solar power developing regions, supporting the global transition to clean power, and taking action against climate change. Sun Exchange solar cells also offer a convient way for individuals who are new to cryptocurrency to start building cryptocurrency wealth backed by tangible assets that are managed, maintained and in-sured. Additionally, Sun Exchange enables cryptocurrency holders to diversify their assets and convert theoretical wealth into tangible and valuable energy-generating solar assets.


To further accelerate access to solar energy globally, and to grow its community of inspired members actively participating in the global transition to solar power, Sun Exchange is now introducing SUNEX, the native network token for the Sun Exchange platform.

While solar energy has taken off and quickly spread across the globe, it has unfortunately lagged behind in the developing regions that need it most. This includes Africa and the Middle East, where lack of access to solar project financing remains a significant obstacle. South Africa is an emerging and industrialised nation with large and increasing demand for energy. Its electricity infrastructure is outdated, almost entirely coal-powered and owned and operated by a state-owned monopoly. To date, Sun Exchange has focused on enabling solar projects in South Africa, one of the sunniest countries in the world and has established an international network of major solar installation companies and project developers that specialise in identifying and building these small to medium-scale commercial solar plants.

Sun Exchange offers its members solar power asset ownership opportunities that tradi-tionally have only been available to institutional investors. Purchasing solar cells within Sun Exchange projects decentralises solar power plant ownership, ensuring that the environmental and socioeconomic issues of centralised energy supplies, inherent in the fossil fuel industries, are not replicated as the world migrates to clean energy. Sun Exchange is establishing a globally-distributed clean energy virtual transactive smart grid, giving the international community a chance to collectively own its energy sources, maximising the potential for redistribution of wealth.

Sun Exchange was developed directly in response to the urgent global need for continued proliferation of clean, decentralised energy, and to harness the opportunity presented by the parallel developments in solar and blockchain technologies.

The main components of blockchain technology Sun Exchange integrates are:

SUNEX Tokens
Cryptocurrency payments
Smart Contracts and IoT Sensors
Solar Project Insurance Fund (SPIF) Smart Contracts
SUNEX tokens will be available to the general public and existing platform members. The tokens are designed to make solar asset ownership through Sun Exchange more affordable and rewarding, while making electricity production more profitable and accessible. SUNEX tokens may be staked on the Sun Exchange platform’s new Solar Project Insurance Fund to provide a buffer against losses from solar lease contract defaults. The SPIF provides more secure solar asset ownership opportunities for Sun Exchange members. SUNEX token benefits also include a loyalty programme which unlocks access to solar cell purchase discounts and rental bonuses, and gamification features designed to diversify and maximise impact of members’ solar cell portfolios. The more SUNEX a Sun Exchange member owns, the higher they pro-gress through the tiers and the more valuable their benefits become.

The Sun Exchange marketplace enables individuals and organizations across the globe to buy solar cells and lease them to be installed in commercial and industrial solar projects and mini-grids. Solar cell owners earn rental income directly from their solar assets, which are installed into projects that bring solar power to emerging markets.

Sun Exchange targets two key audience groups: Solar power offtakers and Solar cell purchasers/members.

Sun Exchange was Launched on Indiegogo in 2015. The platform has been running for 3 years and has won Best Bitcoin & Blockchain Business in Africa Award in 2016 and 2017. Won Global blockchain Challenge in 2017. Their model is Solar Panel Micro-leasing using Bitcoin as the payment system. This model is universally scalable and doesn’t face the regulatory obstacles that P2P energy trading platforms like of Powerledger and Wepower will face. Also the platform exists today, it can already be used, so impatient token holders dont need to wait long to utilise their SUNEX tokens. Sun Exchange received VC funding of $1.6m in September 2017. This is very important as it shows that the core business and team was subjected to very detailed institutional level due diligence very recently, and with existing funding behind them the core team are getting paid to work full time with no compromise.

The Tatiana Coin is ushering in a new way of funding artists, through a Bitcoin-driven platform, which involves fans in a long-term relationship with the artist they choose to support.

Tatiana chose to use the model of the “Artist Coin” due to the fact that she says it offers “unique ways for people to become part of the creative process where as the fan base grows, the more valuable the tokens become.” She further explained that, “this program incentivizes stronger relationships with fans where fans gain access to behind the scenes parties, sponsorship opportunities, early releases and more.”

From June 3rd to July 1st, 2014, a campaign will be launched to promote Tatiana’s third studio album. The amount of money raised will determine which “tier of success” she is able to reach in her journey to fund everything from breaking even on her third album, to creating the first ever crypto music label.

The Tatiana Coin is powered by CoinPowers.com, which is a new Crypto-Property Crowdsale platform running on the Counter Party protocol, an innovative, distributed technology that enables anyone to issue their own smart property or currency.

","BanQu is a groundbreaking for-profit / for-purpose blockchain-as-a-service software company solving the toughest global problem – Extreme Poverty.

As the world’s first and only non-cryptocurrency blockchain platform—we help lift people out of extreme poverty by connecting them to the global supply chains they participate in and the brands, organizations, and governments that power them.

Through the implementation of BanQu’s cutting-edge blockchain platform, we provide benefits to the businesses, organizations, and governments that interact with the world’s poorest on a daily basis. Each of these interactions are captured through a secure, immutable, and distributed ledger of financial and personal records using blockchain technology—in turn building the Economic Identities necessary to connect the “unbanked / underbanked” to the global economy, thus helping to lift them out of poverty.

BanQu allows the unbanked to set up a personal digital identification profile while connecting them to the global supply chains they participate in (i.e. brands/ companies they work for, banked network including family, friends, small businesses, and associated NGOs). As they start accumulating a transaction history on the BanQu blockchain, the unbanked also develop a trackable, vetted financial and personal history. Our blockchain platform allows people to record a variety of transactions including business exchanges, remote purchases, funded wallets, term purchases, cash disbursements, property records, health records, education records, and credit histories among others. This Economic Identity provides a baseline for the unbanked to participate in the global economy. In return—BanQu’s platform provides benefits to the businesses, organizations, and governments that interact with these unbanked individuals on a daily basis.

We are working with a strong focus on green community growth and betterment of Mother Earth. We want to create a platform that people would love to be part of.
 
 The company invests in innovative clean energy initiatives and renewable energy projects, with a key focus on accelerating renewable energy adoption across Southeast Asia. 
 
 ABOUT OUR PROTOCOL
 NERA is developing a protocol that redefines the way the world looks at clean energy. Clean adoption accounts for less than 4% of global energy consumption and deteriorating climate continues to threaten our future generations. Yet there are over US$200B of green funds available in the world today and over 60% of companies today claim that they are doing their part for Mother Earth.
 
 The NERA Blockchain intends to enable a transparent and consensus-based tracking of emission reduction activities at the individual level. In turn, each community member will be awarded with Emission Reduction Unit (“ERU”) as a “proof-of-green” standard of measurement. ERUs are awarded based on emission-reducing green activities, including CO2 reduction efforts, clean energy adoption/production, and green campaigning efforts. In combining the inherent qualities of accountability, transparency and security of the NERA Blockchain, NERA aims to make the ERU a global standard in measuring the clean energy footprint of every individual and organization. 
 
 The proposed currency underpinning the ERUs on the NERA Blockchain will be our ERC-20 standard NERA Tokens, which will be deployed to facilitate all transactions (online and offline) within the NERA ecosystem. It is envisioned that NERA Tokens will be a widely-adopted currency, accepted by a range of institutions, businesses and merchants in support of the clean energy movement ignited by NERA.
 
 We anticipate that the web interface for NERA will be delivered by end of Q1 2018,
 and the mobile interface to be delivered by Q2 2018.
 
 
 OUR VISION
 
 Decentralized
 The NERA protocol aims to record how much emission is saved and earned across the world through a patent pending certification process by NGOs and Institutions.
 
 Decarbonized
 With NERA’s proposed solution, the team aims to reduce pollution impact and increase renewable energy projects across the world in response to the threat of climate change by keeping a global temperature rise this century.

Learn More

Our vision is that ethically conscious people from all walks of life have embraced the power of technology to ensure a modern, progressive world where everyone lives in freedom, respect and dignity.

Our mission is to eradicate modern slavery by empowering businesses, governments and consumers with new information and technology that guarantees slave-free products.

We are ethically conscious, forward-thinking people who believe slavery has no place in the modern world. We come to slavefreetrade from all walks of life and from all over the world with a shared belief that informed choices empowered by technology can ensure a world without slavery. 

the first verification framework dedicated to
eliminating slavery in business supply chains

 

Central to slavefreetrade’s mission are the world’s consumers and retailers; workers and employers; and businesses and their suppliers. The distance between people in these groups has resulted in a lack of knowledge by consumers about who and how products are made, a lack of respect for the human rights of 45 million workers, and a lack of clear sight and responsibility to the end of every supply chain.

And our mission is to create a movement.

A movement of people who care about the people behind the things they buy.

A movement of businesses committed to more than traditional profit that includes their workers.

And for them, there is the potential of increased economic value – doing good will be a bonus.

Our theory of change revolves around re-building relationships based on trust between the main actors in our consumerist system. All of our actions aim to foster circles of trust, interlinked, to form a holistic, ethical system bounded by respect for human life and the world we live in.

slavefreetrade seeks to change the way we treat the people who make the products we buy. We do this because enslavement is below human dignity and should not be suffered by anyone.

To achieve such radical change, we fully intend to subvert the social order wrought by rampant consumerism. We will replace it with aware, conscious, consumer ethicalism.

Firmly of the view that technology of blockchain is ushering in a new era of possibilities for a more equal and just world, we harness the transformative power of the transparency it brings, and we couple it with what we feel is a new wave of human consciousness.

The result of this coupling? A world free of slaves.
To achieve this, we have developed a suite of programmes involving the primary audiences business listen to – namely – consumer, governments, investors, bankers, insurers, other businesses, and the media.",,"The first verification framework dedicated to

 Sun Fund is a real-world company building revenue generating renewable energy assets that is also developing an Ethereum-based blockchain currency platform. With the ability to implement smart contracts on a distributed ledger, the Sun Fund token will bring liquidity and a store of value for renewable energy assets while also helping to disintermediate global financial and energy markets.
 
 As far as we know, we are more profitable than other renewable energy companies because we focus on the small and medium-scale commercial and industrial solar markets that have better margins and incentives. For example, larger solar companies will construct a 20 megawatt solar plant and only get paid five or six cents per kilowatt of electricity generated. Our projects are much smaller, but generate anywhere from 14 to 25 cents per kilowatt.
 
 We have a pipeline of over 55 megawatts of projects so we plan to put your investment dollars to work generating revenue right away.
 
 Sun Fund is also bringing renewable energy to Bitcoin and other coin mining operations to help make coin mining environmentally sustainable.
 
 Before crowdfunding, companies like Sun Fund could only work with private investors. Now these investments are available to everyone.
 
 We are inspired by the Toms Shoes One-to-One model but we are taking that further with our 250 to 1 model. We will bring electricity to 250 families in the developing world who currently do not have electricity for every one megawatt of solar that we install in the United States.

UN Women’s Deputy Executive Director, Yannick Glemarec, and Innovation Norway’s CEO, Anita Krohn Traaset, signed the first Memorandum of Understanding between the two organizations today at a high-level event in Trondheim, Norway, where the guests of honour included the Crown princess Mette Marit and Norway’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Børge Brende.

By the current rate of progress, the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 will not be possible, and women and girls in humanitarian crises impacted contexts are at most risk of being left behind. For example, maternal mortality in humanitarian crises and in fragile settings is 1.9 times the world average, and the number of maternal deaths in these countries represent 61 per cent of the total number of maternal deaths worldwide [1].

Innovation and technology provide unprecedented opportunities to reach those who arethe farthest and hardest to reach by breaking isolation and creating economies of scale to accelerate the achievement of gender equality and women’s empowerment.

By working together, UN Women and Innovation Norway will enhance innovative approaches and solutions in response to addressing gender inequality issues, particularly in humanitarian contexts. The collaboration will also help to identify future public-private partnerships and strengthen the private sector’s engagement in generating innovations.

“During our stay here in Norway we have visited incubators and met with Norwegian entrepreneurs that develop innovative humanitarian solutions that can strengthen women’s empowerment. UN Women believes that this agreement is the beginning of a close partnership that will enable us to build stronger ties between the needs that we identify in our work and the innovative products that are being developed,” said Mr. Glemarec.

The partnership between UN Women and Innovation Norway will create platforms and projects, which will include exploring making blockchain technology work for women and girls. Blockchain technology offers users the ability to build and maintain immutable and secure personal records and to directly transfer digital assets without the need for intermediaries and associated costs. Thus, women and girls in crises will be able to have safe records of documents that are essential to rebuilding their lives and for economic activities. UN Women will participate in a hackathon at the Katapult Future Fest taking place in Norway in May to explore the potential of blockchain as a solution to some of the problems that women face in humanitarian contexts.

“This agreement makes the Norwegian private sector and innovation a bigger part of the solution”, said Norway’s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Børge Brende.

Broadly, the collaboration between UN Women and Innovation Norway will focus on:

Enhancing innovative approaches and solutions to address gender inequality issues;
Promoting women, especially marginalized groups, as both producers and consumers of innovations;
Promoting public-private partnerships and strengthening the private sector’s engagement in innovations to accelerate gender equality and women’s empowerment, notably through competency building and knowledge sharing;
Sharing best practices, methodologies, and lessons learned around innovations to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment;
Promoting the Sustainable Development Goals.

We aim to recast what ""PHM"" and ""PHR"" mean, and to revolutionize the way we incentivize and invest in prevention. 

It's 2016, and healthcare is not about data, and not about stand-alone solutions: it is about building platforms that link silos and spark collaboration. That is why we are building a 'plug and play' rewards and data analytics layer for prevention. It is an inch thick and thousands of miles wide; a global enabler of a new kind of prevention network that engages at every scale, from users and their friends to doctors to local communities and health plans to countries and international health organizations. 

We are not a wellness app. 'Wellness' hasn't panned out as hoped, but that is because it is only part of the solution. Instead, Healthcoin is an integration machine. We pull the now-separate prevention nodes -- employers, plans, hospitals, life insurers, governments, wellness apps -- into a network. That network trades in a market for rewarding proven prevention that includes long term ""futures"" contracts; it readily verifies when someone has successfully prevented their disease over their lifetime; it accesses data, at a glance, that can help them improve population preventative health; it builds shared, targeted programs, as in where a city, hospital and major employer collaborate to target the same zip code with a prevention program. It can even allow two cities, in different countries, to compete to see who can be the best at proven prevention. 
What does Healthcoin do? It leverages everything that the blockchain excels at: openness, accessibility, tokenization, digitized certificates, protocols, scalability, trust, immutability, and encryption. Above all, though, it uses the blockchain not just as an ideal future state. Instead, Healthcoin uses aspects of the blockchain to deliberately drive adoption. Adoption is the thing we obsess about. Adoption happens when you give users, doctors and partners a reason to engage in a low-risk, incremental and self-reinforcing manner. We make it easy to join Healthcoin, and the more hop on board, the easier and more enticing it is to join.

City Chain is a blockchain project that we in Liberstad has been planning and working on since early 2017. In February 2018 the City Chain Foundation was established and development of the blockchain and software was initiated and led by Sondre Bjellås.

City Chain will be used for many services in Liberstad including :
Crypto-currency
Property registration
Vehicle registration
Identification system
Smart contracts
Business registry
Insurance
Certifications
Subscriptions
and more

The first application for City Chain is its crypto-currency City Coin 

What is City Coin
City Coin (CITY) is the crypto currency that runs on City Chain. It is the medium of exchange and payment for services on the City Chain.

The City Chain is a Proof-of-Stake blockchain, making it more accessible to people without the need for hardware investments for mining. Instead of mining, you can decide if you want to use your coins for staking. As a staker, you provide a service to the community and the network, and receive staking award in the form of new coins for every block you are selected to stake.

City Coin will be partially premined and all those coins will be donated to three different non-profit foundations:
City Chain Foundation (20%)
Private City Fund (55%) (under development)
Private Business Incubator Program (25%) (not operational yet)

Private City Fund
55 percent of the premined City Coins has been donated to Private City Fund.  Private City Funds mission is help establish private start-up cities, micro-nations and other communities that is founded upon the voluntaryist philosophy.

The funds that are donated to Private City Fund is intended to last 200 years and each year the fund will be allowed to use 1/200th of the funds for a yearly budget. A large part of the Private City Funds yearly budget goes to funding various projects and Liberstad has been granted a one-time amount of 10 mill CITY in addition to a monthly payout of 200k CITY

Liberstad's CITY Coins
In Liberstad we do not wish to pay our workers in government fiat currency and until now everyone has been working without compensation on a voluntary basis.
​
A large portion of the City Coins we have received will therefor be used as salary for our workers and also compensation for external work that is related to the continuous development of Liberstad.

City Coin will therefor be the only means of payment for our workers in Liberstad. Citycoins can be used directly as payment for products and services in Liberstad or can be exchanged for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies on Liberstad Block Exchange.

Valuation of CITY Coins
Because City Coins (CITY) is a brand new cryptocurrency and is not yet traded on any exchanges, there is no market valuation of CITY.  During our joint development of City Chain together with the City Chain Foundation we had to set a desired initial valuation of CITY to calculate the number of coins that was to be issued on a yearly basis over the next 200 years as well as how much was to be donated to each of the three funds.

We agreed on a initial valuation of 1 NOK (0.12 USD) per CITY and we will therefor base our hourly wage for workers on this valuation. Workers in Liberstad will be paid between 150 and 300 CITY pr hour depending on the work and qualifications.

City Hub
​City Hub is the name of the wallet where you can send, receive and store your Citycoins. In the wallet you can also stake your coins and receive reward in the form of new coins. City Hub is currently available for PC, Mac or Linux. A smartphone version for Android or iOS will be launched in the near future. You can download the latest version of City Hub by clicking on the link below.

What problems does Impact Earth solve?
The world is facing global challenges for sustainable development with focus on:

reducing CO2 emissions globally to reduce the effects of climate change
urbanisation, solving the demand for affordable housing in urban and off grid rural areas
energy transition, reducing energy consumption using smart, climate design, producing renewable energy on site, and storing and distributing energy though smart networks
addressing water, food and resource scarcity through resource efficient design strategies
Impact Earth’s approach to these problems is circular and inclusive, creating ecological and social value for its customers through community building and education managed on the Ethereum blockchain for transparency and control. Impact investing is a way of investing that creates financial returns for the investor and that makes the world a better and more sustainable place at the same time. Impact projects are typically designed to make communities more sustainable and reduce CO2, to create jobs and provide people with means to improve their livelihood and generate income which will enable them to repay the investors.

However, in many cases these investments are difficult to find, not transparent, difficult to manage and measure. Investment funds, institutions, companies and governments are struggling to do so.

The Impact Earth Solution
The Impact Earth Foundation will be able to offer a portfolio of services to our target clients. Ranging from managing an investment to offering full turnkey investment projects from origination to development and the financing structure. Based on three pillars, Impact Earth is able to provide a strong and unique base of value in this multi-billion industry for the holders of the IMPACTXO Coin.

(Project seems inactive or has been aborted),"Voting over Ledger Technology (The VOLT Project)
This project aims to explore applications of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) in domains involving voting and collective decision making. There are many domains in which some form of balloting is required, such as voting on proposals or electing in charities, professional organisations, clubs, trades unions, political parties, and private companies. It is important to run such ballots in a way that the result is accepted by all parties even where they do not trust each other.

Current election systems require trusted individuals or third party organisations to run the ballot, which places reliance on their honesty and also on their ability to secure the election against any form of malicious attack. The fact that many such elections are still run using paper ballots demonstrates that this remains a real concern for organisations despite the advantages of convenience, cost and efficiency that electronic elections may bring. Given the associated security issues around the management of electronic votes, it is natural to consider the use of DLT platforms to provide a trustworthy basis for such systems in recording and aggregating votes, since they can provide transparency and an agreed tamper-proof record of the election. The project will investigate how this can be achieved while maintaining the necessary levels of security, and in particular how this is impacted by the underlying design of any particular choice of distributed ledger technology.

The introduction of DLT into the voting domain also enables new possibilities for voting schemes. Political systems around the world have evolved complex election systems, for example single transferrable vote, where the results are cumbersome and time-consuming to calculate, but where the result is considered to better reflect the will of the electorate and hence worthy of this effort. However for non-political elections run with paper ballots this effort is generally prohibitive. Social choice theory within Political Science considers how different voting systems can affect how choices are made, and the ability to support such systems electronically enables the viability of schemes whose tallying mechanisms are more complex but which may give results which match more closely the collective choice of the voters. Hence the project will also investigate the potential impact on organisations and their governance and decision making processes through the variation of voting schemes.

DLT also supports the management of more complex voting rights held by individuals. In many private company applications, particular shareholdings have specific rights and privileges. For example, the originating shareholders of a company may have pre-emption rights over the sale of shares by later shareholders, or priority rights to compensation in the event of a bankruptcy of the company. At present, for privately-held companies, shareholdings and the rights associated to them are generally recorded in written contracts and the relevant information held only in spreadsheets. At least in principle, DLTs could readily support voting in such contexts, with the specific rights accruing to particular shareholders being encoded in agreed smart contracts - i.e., automated (self-executing) performance scripts that also sit on the distributed ledger. A strand of this project will aim to explore the practicality of such ideas.

Although the project is not investigating political or statutary elections at this stage, a strand of the project will consider the longer term roadmap for the technology. As well as considering the longer term impact on organisations through new governance and decision making possibilities, this will include consideration of how DLT may play a part in emerging designs for electronic voting systems for political elections.",,Trusted and Transparent Voting using blockchain technologies,,United Kingdom,,,Europe,Western Europe,2017,,academic,https://twitter.com/VOLT_Project,,,,,,,,https://www.publictechnology.net/articles/news/university-surrey-bags-%C2%A311m-trial-blockchain-healthcare-voting-and-digital-archives,,,,,,,"University of Surrey,

KWHCoin will allow the underserved to claim energy independence. Not only will they have the freedom to choose their energy providers, but they can also sell their own renewable energy to others through The Grid in the form of KWH tokens.
By lowering the cost of renewable energy transactions, KWHCoin will allow renewable energy to expand and bring newfound power to the farthest reaches of the world.
Our Vision: We believe that everyone in the world should have renewable energy access as essential to sustainable development. We have a vision of an energy future where all people have access and energy generation is 100% renewable and all members contribute and receive value for their participation.To get there we have five key pillars: 1. Decentralize Energy 2. Democratize Grid Value 3. Digitize Data 4. Distribute Localized Green Energy 5. Develop Virtual Alternative Grid
Our Value: KWHCoin adds value by lowering the cost of renewable energy integration into the grid by providing a platform for prosumers and consumers to connect and configure their energy resources. As we transition to an energy distribution system that is based on a two way generation of power from distributed energy resources from multiple sources the aggregation and value of these resources present a challenge for the energy industry and utilities as grid modernization becomes a top priority.

Mission Statement
eyeWitness seeks to bring to justice individuals who commit atrocities by providing human rights defenders, journalists, and ordinary citizens with a mobile app to capture much needed verifiable video and photos of these abuses. eyeWitness then becomes an ongoing advocate for the footage to promote accountability for those who commit the worst international crimes.

Project Description
In seeking to bring the perpetrators of atrocities to justice, eyeWitness provides a tool for human rights defenders, documenters, journalists, and other courageous citizens, to capture verifiable footage related to international atrocity crimes. Our easy-to-use camera app captures the metadata needed to ensure that images can be used in investigations or trials. It then safely stores the information in a storage facility, hosted by Lexis Nexis and maintained by the eyeWitness organisation. The information we receive is reviewed by the eyeWitness expert team, who then seek to ensure that the data is used to bring perpetrators of international crimes to justice.

Pro Bono Opportunities
eyeWitness to Atrocities partners with outside investigators, attorneys, and law firms who provide pro bono resources to analyse the
information we receive from app users. If you or your firm are interested in
providing pro bono support, please contact us using the General Enquiries
information below.

Why was eyeWitness to Atrocities created?
In November 2010, harrowing footage obtained by UK broadcaster Channel 4 emerged, seemingly showing Sri Lankan troops executing Tamil prisoners. Mark Ellis, Executive Director of the International Bar Association (IBA), was one of the international lawyers asked to examine the video. He found that the authenticity of the footage could not be verified. ‘Watching that film was a catalyst for the idea that an app could be created to act as a tool of verification and allow the video to be admissible in a court of law,’ he says. So began a four-year effort…

How can I capture metadata?
To capture the time, date, location and pixel count, switch the eyeWitness app to secure mode. Press the corner of the app camera screen until it turns blue. Now everything you film will include metadata and be stored in the app’s secure gallery.

How does eyeWitness protect the security of its app users?
There are always risks involved with documenting human rights abuses. There is not only danger from the user’s proximity to a volatile situation, but also the risk of arrest or other repercussions from authorities who do not want information about their actions to be publicised. No technology can completely eliminate those risks. However, we believe that the security of our users is of utmost importance. Therefore, our app incorporates features….

Labor contracts signed by international migrant workers can change from origin to destination due to unethical behavior from recruitment agencies or overseas employers. Workers often end up working in poor conditions for unfair wages. We propose the digitization and storage of “Universal Migrant Worker Contracts” on the blockchain, increasing transparency and security throughout the entire recruitment process.

Standardizes complicated contracts
Handshake guarantees contracts are legal and ethical, and ensures that the contract signed hasn't changed when migrant workers arrive in a new country.

Ensures contracts are upheld
Handshake tracks working conditions and allows employers to be held accountable. It also manages and tracks payments and remittence.

Transparency = Safety
Governments and ethical agencies have transparency into agency and job identities and working conditions, and know when to intercede.

Why Blockchain?
Handshake is built on decentralised services such as IPFS and the Ethereum blockchain, to ensure that labor contracts are legal and verified, and remain untampered. Every party has access to and signs the same contract. We can dictate that contracts follow legal and ethical guidelines before they're ever created.

Blockchain also gives us a system to rigorously verify the ethical nature and legitimacy of both agencies and job sites, each of which create their own uPort identity.

Long term, the blockchain allows us to enforce contracts in migrant workers' places of work, to make sure they're getting paid and able to send money back to their family.",,Protecting the human rights of migrant workers,,,,,#N/A,#N/A,2013,Al Chen,,"https://twitter.com/joinhandshake

Paris - April 10th, 2018 - ENGIE and AIR PRODUCTS have signed a contract that will allow AIR PRODUCTS to maximise, trace and certify the green energy used in its manufacturing process, using blockchain technology.

The AIR PRODUCTS & ENGIE contract represents a double revolution in customer-supplier relationships, giving AIR PRODUCTS access to its own daily green certification system, but also ensuring it can associate relevant certification to its customers.

AIR PRODUCTS will be able to identify green energy generation assets for an industrial gas production facility in France, based on their availability. Using blockchain technology, ENGIE will offer AIR PRODUCTS tamper-proof traceability of the origin of its green energy in near-real time.
ENGIE and AIR PRODUCTS will develop an innovative offering enabling AIR PRODUCTS to certify the actual source of green energy used in the day-to-day manufacture of its products to its customers.
This step-out green electricity supply contract has established AIR PRODUCTS and ENGIE as pioneers in the certification of “green” industrial products in France – all thanks to the traceability offered by the blockchain protocol.

In practice, ENGIE will link the production of a wind farm in the Aveyron area and two hydroelectric plants of SHEM1 (in Eget, Hautes-Pyrénées and Marèges, Corrèze) to the AIR PRODUCTS’ point of consumption at the Saint-Quentin Fallavier, Isère plant. Blockchain technology will ensure day-to-day tamper-proof energy certification as well as information on how the amount of renewable energy injected into the grid correlates with electricity consumption at the plant2.

ENGIE will equip AIR PRODUCTS with a private web interface allowing it to directly view the production of identified renewable assets and access its own certificates registered in the blockchain.

AIR PRODUCTS can then associate its green energy certificates to the products delivered to its customers. Its customers can then use this data for their own Corporate Social Responsibility review.

""Certification by blockchain technology gives ENGIE the opportunity to transform its customer-supplier relationship. We not only provide green electricity, we support our customers in their energy transition"" said Edouard Neviaski, CEO of ENGIE's Global Energy Management Business Unit, which manages the Group's activities on energy markets. ""With this type of contract, our ambition is two-fold: to improve the monitoring of green energy consumption by our customers and to enable our customers to be involved in their traceability to the final consumer”.

""With this traceable green energy system, we can better support them in their sustainable development approach, just as we’re already doing with our logistics strategy, aiming to be more respectful of the environment.” concludes Kurt Lefevere, Vice President Northern Continent Industrial Gases Europe at AIR PRODUCTS.

The two firms are aiming to educate people in crisis about cryptocurrencies by introducing the ZEN token to them. ZEN is a digital coin introduced by Horizen in mid-2017.

Crisis in Venezuela
In the initial phase, the firms are targeting the heavily affected communities in Venezuela. Venezuela is facing a massive economic crisis which has turned into a grave problem in the last few years. The increasing inflation in the country has resulted in its fiat currency becoming a worthless piece of paper.

The crisis is so massive, that thousands of people are starving, and according to a Vox report, one month’s salary of a low-wage employee in the country is barely enough to by a single hot dog sandwich.

This has resulted in a massive influx of refugees from Venezuela to the Columbian border-town of Cucuta. According to reports, over 2.3 million people have fled from Venezuela over the last four years to escape staggering inflation, food, and medicine shortages.

However, the refugees only carry Venezuelan bolivars which are not accepted in Colombia. Moreover, due to the decreasing value of the bolivar, it becomes very difficult to exchange them for Colombian pesos.

“Together we are providing ZEN paper wallets and education to those in need, ensuring they have secure ways to access and control their money no matter where they are and what situation they are in,” the official statement noted. ”We are also onboarding 100 local merchants to begin accepting ZEN as payments.”

Cripto Conserje has also launched Alpha Project to increase cryptocurrency adoption in Latin America, especially in Cucuta.

(Project seems inactive or has been aborted),"RootProject harnesses crowdfunding and cryptocurrency for the social good, while offering token purchasers a cryptocurrency with built-in growth and social capital.

The new digital currency, called Roots tokens, will be sold and exchanged for dollars to fund community projects targeting the poor. Some Roots tokens will even be reserved to support a pension fund for individual project workers. The RootsProject’s presale of Root coins alone generated well over $200,000 for the organization.

ROOTPROJECT IS A
DUAL-FACING APP

You’re walking down the street, and you see a run-down public park that could use some sprucing up, new benches, and some play equipment for neighborhood kids. Using the RootProject app you post the project online where your friends and neighbors agree to fund it.

When a community campaign reaches its goal, RootProject or a partner nonprofit steps in and completes the work, sourcing most of the labor from those below the poverty line. The workers get paid in ordinary U.S. dollars.

An amount equal to half of the workers’ wages gets deposited in RootProject cryptocurrency (ROOTS tokens) into an innovative pension-style program for the workers. Beginning 18 months after the work, the workers could receive disbursements from the fund – converted into U.S. dollars – provided they meet conditions designed to help them leave the streets. That cryptocurrency pension does two things – it incentivizes positive behavior by the workers, and it drives up the value of the cryptocurrency.”

THE MAIN FEATURES OF ROOTPROJECT INCLUDE:

LABORLESS CROWDFUNDING
A new crowdfunding model creates supply and demand for community projects. Project initiators don’t need to complete the project or know anything about cryptocurrencies. Donors get tax deductions. Socially visible projects enhance reputations.

CRYPTOCURRENCY
A portion of a project’s crowdfunded proceeds go to token purchases, driving currency demand. The rest goes to material, one supervisor’s wages, and wages for those stuck in poverty to complete the project. The currency’s supply is hard capped, so each project reduces liquid token supply.

‘PENSION’ FUND AND INTEREST ALIGNMENT
In addition to hourly wages, paid in USD, cryptocurrency worth half of the day’s earnings is deposited into a medium-term pension fund-like entity – further reducing liquid token supply and aligning the interests of investors and society’s most vulnerable.

We’re a startup, so for our launch we’re partnering with some incredible nonprofits that have been around for decades, and will continue to do so as we scale our operations.

 ",Government & Democracy,Government & Democracy,Voting,Voting,,,,"9, 16",,,,",9,16,",2,a secure and transparent online voting solution for the modern age,"Follow My Vote is a startup using distributed ledgers to run voting processes and prevent identity theft. One of the significant advantages of voters using blockchains like the one underlying Follow My Vote is that users can verify voting choices at any point in time.

What

With the ability to audit the ballot box and watch elections progress in real time, Follow My Vote's platform offers unparalleled electoral transparency.

Let’s face it. No one except for election officials really know what happens to your vote once you cast it, so it’s not surprising that more and more research is showing that citizens don’t vote because they don’t believe their votes count. Understandably, these frustrated voters are losing confidence in our democratic system.

Enter Follow My Vote’s online voting platform. Using a webcam and a government-issued ID, voters can remotely and securely log in and vote for their desired candidates. After they’ve selected their candidates, they can use their unique Voter ID to quite literally open the ballot box, locate their vote, and check that it is both present and correct. Additionally, voters can then watch the election progress in real time as votes are cast. What’s more, Follow My Vote’s platform allows for an indecisive voter to return to the system and switch his or her votes at any time before the election deadline closes.  

The ability to change your vote, coupled with the ability to observe the election in real time, has major implications for the current two-party system. Now, voters who would like to vote for a third party candidate are likely not to for fear of wasting their vote on a candidate who is not likely to win. In some instances, voting for a third party draws votes from one of the two dominant parties that has similar views and increases the chances the opposition party will win. With the ability to change their vote, voters can counteract this vote-splitting effect and shake up the current two-party system.  

Follow My Vote’s platform offers convenience which will likely improve voter turnout among younger generations and provide troops abroad, the elderly, and the disabled a viable alternative to current voting methods. Democracy can’t function if almost half of citizens aren’t voting; and in this regard Follow My Vote is striving to restore the democratic tradition.  

Another advantage Follow My Vote’s system offers is cost-effectiveness. In the United States, millions of dollars of taxpayer money are spent on line items such as printing ballots and mailing voter information alone. These are unnecessary costs that will be reduced over time by moving voting online, as Follow My Vote plans to do.  

Follow My Vote's software comes with the security of blockchain technology and is open-source so that anyone can audit the software’s code.  Keep reading to learn more about blockchain technology and why we believe that decentralization is the key to secure online voting.

The heart of the KOINA system is the KOINA money. KOINA is basically a credit network and KOINA credits are created by a delivery promise into the future from producers to the KOINA community. The underlining principle is a unilateral/social contract (one2all) instead of a bilateral contract (one2one). KOINA is a debt-free, positive monetary system.

Vision
We feel responsible to significantly contribute to the global transformation process into a sustainable economy! Therefor KOINA is building up a sustainable monetary system that serves this public purpose.

Aim
KOINA enables producers to issue credit which allows them to finance their future production independently. Our goal is to establish a global credit network with its own market-specific currency to generate a homogeneus market.

Strategy
The fundament of the KOINA compliant techno-legal framework is a social contract. The system is powered by a proprietary smartchain.

In 2016 alone, it has been estimated that $2.8bn was disbursed through cash and vouchers.

The term “cash transfer programming” describes all the various mechanisms of cash transfers, including cash-for-work and vouchers, used to implement programs. While cash transfer is a methodology used to achieve program goals – not a program aim itself – the term “cash transfer programming” has been widely adopted as the overall description for any use of these mechanisms in field programs.

Since the advent of Bitcoin in 2008, social innovators have striven to leverage cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies to develop faster, cheaper remittances, new solutions in micro-finance, and a whole host of CTP solutions.

","Fummi is a Smart ID built on blockchain. Fummi enables authorized payments and access to benefits.

Fummi
Fummi, Blockchain for Change’s first product, is a mobile application designed to provide low-cost financial services through cooperative purchasing partnerships for low-income and underserved individuals. These interactions use what we call a SmartID: a proprietary protocol for enabling a certified authority to verify identity on the blockchain. This method of verification called the Change Pass verifies a user’s access to the Fummi marketplace and enables secure transactions and safe storage of money and information.

Change Coin
The Change Coin is an ERC 20 token that is used as a currency within the Fummi ecosystem. The Change Coin functions as an access point and transaction mechanism between users, service providers, and the Fummi
platform. Within that system, the Change Coin is set up to encourage value-creating activity via behavioral incentives. For example, when a user’s SmartID is stored on the platform/blockchain, the user receives a reward of 30 Change Coins for successfully onboarding onto the platform.

Fummi harnesses blockchain technology to redefine the usage of digital identity for financial services. These financial services provide low-cost specialized interactions for users opening the doors to the digital economy. 
Service providers have access to a cooperative network, which grants organizational transparency and auditability (which enables low-cost services). Due to the inherent fraud prevention and management of encrypted data on the permitted blockchain, service providers are incentivized to secure their users’ data with our SmartID. Originators of user data are rewarded in Change Coin when other service providers utilize the user IDs for services. 

Users use their SmartID to interact and transact with providers. This identity permits users to store money safely, access new opportunities such as building a alternative credit score, and getting discounted services from service providers. The record of interactions itself drives the Fummi attestation strategy, validating the SmartID data and applicability.

(Project seems inactive or has been aborted)","Sustainability International is a U.S.-based nonprofit that provides innovative solutions to complex sustainability and conservation issues in the developing world. Sustainability International empowers communities to alleviate corruption and poverty. 

It leverages breakthrough technologies, such as blockchain and virtual reality, to address the world's toughest environmental and economic challenges. SI believes that transparency and economic inclusion will bring the billions of people living in the shadows of society into the forefront.

SI is currently incubating Sela, an enterprise blockchain payments platform that reverses the havoc that systemic corruption has wreaked on the value of hard work and reputation.

Sustainability International's current large-scale initiative hopes to revitalize the region through its Clean Up Niger Delta Project.

How Blockchain Technology is Helping to Clean the Niger River
Ogoniland, situated off the coast of the Gulf of Guinea in southeastern Nigeria, is considered the most polluted region along the Niger Delta and among the worst in the world. 

There has never been a cleanup of the oil spills in the Niger Delta, culminating in 50 years of neglect and lack of accountability among oil and gas companies, wealthy elites and the government. Consequently, as sentiment is changing toward solving the problem, all the parties - the government, oil companies and the community - no longer trust each other.

This presented the opportunity to experiment with the blockchain at the community level. ""We have their trust, and that is what is most important at the moment,"" said SI CEO Chinyere Nnadi.

As such, Sustainability International is planning to launch multiple controlled pilots in one village over the next year. Nnadi said they will conduct interviews with the villagers to determine the best design application for the people.

The blockchain aspect of Sustainability International's project creates an added level of trust in the platform.

""The individuals on the ground don't need to trust each other; they just need to trust the platform/system,"" he said. ""It reduces the fear of corruption that can sometimes drive people away from integrity.""

Sustainability International and the blockchain coalition will use smart contracts to prevent corruption and return trust back to Ogoniland.

""With smart contracts and cryptocurrency, we can create 'programmable money,' which allows us to then 'program' human actions,"" added Siegel. ""If we incentivize people to continuously perform a series of tasks in order to receive a sustained flow of funds, we might be able to create a system in which the most likely 'corrupt' actors are incentivized for not being corrupt.""

A group of South African blockchain enthusiasts founded a company named 9needs in 2012. Their aim is to use the distributed ledger technology for the solution of many social problems that fester post-apartheid Africa.

Over three years, the company developed several projects. The main one is Amply, a set of blockchain implementations that will allow the government of South Africa to manage Early Childhood Developments Services better.

Early Childhood Development Services is a network of state-funded special centres that help children from the lower strata of South African society to socialise, foster various skills and enter state schools. According to official data, Early Childhood Development centres provide communities with different services from basic nutrition assistance to teacher development programs.

Amply project will use a distributed ledger to improve the documentation system in the network of state-coordinated centres.

“Amply is using blockchain technology to improve Early Childhood Development (ECD) services in South Africa. Using blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts, we prototyped a system that will help strengthen the current registration, contracting, information and management systems,” states the company.

In the following year, 9needs will conduct a test use of blockchain at 50 ECD centres in South Africa. The company applied for a newly-established UNICEF grant program and won $100,000. 9needs will invest the money in the implementation of the project.

This is the first-ever investment into a blockchain company through the UNICEF Innovation Fund, which is

“…A new way of doing business at the UN; combining the approach of Silicon Valley venture funds with the needs of UNICEF programme countries. The Fund allows us to prototype technology solutions, as well as expand our networks of open source collaborators to improve children’s lives,” explains Cynthia McCaffrey, Director of the UNICEF Office of Innovation.

Previously, the international organisation declared its readiness to experiment with the blockchain technology.

Akiri Switch is a software-defined network (SDN) and secure routing protocol for healthcare data. This data, which Akiri never stores, spans the entire spectrum of health and medical information. Akiri supports security, identification, authentication, compliance, analytics, and applications.

HOW DOES THE SYSTEM WORK?
 
Akiri Switch acts as a private networking service. It enables secure and compliant transport of health data. It operates as a subscription network. And it verifies the sources and destinations of data in real time. Akiri Switch does not store data. Ever.

WHICH COMPANIES CAN JOIN THE NETWORK?
 
Subscribers can include any healthcare provider, health insurance payer, pharmaceutical company, health technology company, or healthcare organization. Both Health2047 (the American Medical Association's innovation enterprise) and Celgene (a global pharmaceutical company) are already collaborating with Akiri.

WHO IS BACKING AKIRI?
Akiri (first incorporated as ""Health2047 SwitchCo, Inc."") received a $10 million Series A investment from Health2047.

WHAT IS AKIRI’S BUSINESS MODEL?
Akiri will build, manage, operate, and maintain the Akiri Switch network. Partners can sell solutions and services on top of the network. Akiri itself will offer a portfolio of products and services to help clients maximize the value of the network and protocol.

DOES AKIRI SWITCH STORE DATA OR MANAGE ACCOUNTS?
 
No, Akiri Switch does not store data of any type from patients, physicians, providers, or payers. Nor does Akiri manage accounts on behalf of any person, group, or company. Instead, we enable the secure method of transferring health-related data.

IS AKIRI SWITCH A NETWORK OR A PROTOCOL?
 
Akiri Switch is both a network and a protocol. As a network, Akiri does three things. First, it sets policies and configures data layers. Second, it imbeds security in every transfer. Third, it manages detection, authorization, and compliance. As a protocol, Akiri authorizes anyone with appropriate rights, which are assessed in the control layer, to communicate or transfer data.

IS AKIRI AN HIE, AN ETL, OR AN EMR?
No, Akiri and Akiri Switch is not a health information exchange (HIE); an extract, transform, load (ETL) process; or an electronic medical record (EMR) system. Instead, Akiri is a network for facilitating the flow of healthcare data as well as the protocol for transferring the data in real time.

WHAT HEALTHCARE DATA DOES AKIRI SUPPORT?
Akiri Switch supports information contained in or metadata from any source related to health. This may include any information from or for test results, clinical trials, fitness equipment, prescriptions, or thousands of other sources.

IS AKIRI SWITCH SIMILAR TO SWIFT MESSAGING?
Yes, in several ways, Akiri is similar to SWIFT's messaging service for financial institutions. SWIFT enables automated financial communication among subscribers at more than 11,000 financial institutions. Akiri does the same for healthcare data among subscribers. Like SWIFT, Akiri will not store any data.

DOES AKIRI USE BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY?
Akiri leverages blockchain principles. Blockchain is a distributed digital record or ledger, similar to a database, with built-in safeguards to ensure that only people authorized do so can make changes to the data. Akiri does not store data. Instead, it’s a network for securely transmitting information through a standardized system of codes",,Trusted networks for health data,San Francisco,United States,,,North America,North America,2018,"Douglass Given MD, Chairman; Daphne Li, Chief Operating Office",start-up,https://twitter.com/akiri_switch,https://www.facebook.com/akiri.switch/,,,,,,,https://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/news/2018/01/03/akiri-switch-blockchain-health-care.html,,,,,,,,"United States, Canada",Northern America,Northern America,,,"info@akiri.com

(Project seems inactive or has been aborted),"Solar DAO is a blockchain project aimed at building a community of users who have decided to finance the construction of PV solar plants (PVS) by utilizing a crowdfunding model to capitalize on their work.
 Solar DAO establishes a community dedicated for crowdfunding PV solar plants (PVS) worldwide: to construct, launch and manage them to get profit.
 Solar DAO will allow the users to finance and own PV solar plants across the globe with minimal risks involved and bypass the technical barriers associated with the implementation of PVS.
 Solar DAO offers the newest financial tool which empowers users to easily, anonymously and safely subsidize the construction of PV solar plants (PVS) on a global scale, circumventing the costs of intermediaries, arranging deals and eradicating technical and other barriers.
 Solar DAO will operate as an investment fund, continuously expanding the total capacity of the PV solar plants under the management of DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). This will be accomplished through selling constructed PVS plants and refinancing the construction of new ones with larger capacity.
 Solar DAO utilizes the Ethereum blockchain, which:
 1. Provides its users with the opportunity to buy DAO shares (tokens), own and trade them anonymously, and acquire dividends dependent on the results of their work.
 2. Secures the transparency of all processes related to the PVS construction.
 For the purpose of the project, we will create smart contracts and issue tokens, which will facilitate dividend payment, without disclosing the identity of the token owner.
 Solar DAO will raise funds by means of Initial Coin Offer (ICO).",,Become a PV Solar Plant co-Owner,Tel Aviv,Israel,,,Middle east,Middle east,,"Dmitriy Solodukha, Founder & CEO; Oleg Solodukha Co-Founder & CTO",start-up,https://twitter.com/solardao,https://www.facebook.com/solar.dao/,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlbuhei-jrk,https://solardao.me/files/wpeng.pdf,,,,,SDAO,,,,,,,,,,,hi@solardao.me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(Project seems inactive or has been aborted)","RadioYo is building an open source blockchain-based broadcasting and services platform where developers, consumers, podcasters, service providers and advertisers can openly collaborate, track ownership of content and content creators can be rewarded for their work. With this move, RadioYo is demonstrating its commitment to transparency and an open internet.

Our vision is to have an open source blockchain-based broadcasting and services platform where developers, consumers, podcasters, service providers and advertisers can openly collaborate, track ownership of content or rewarding content creators. With the RAO, a new cryptocurrency at its center, RadioYo is building out a new model that enriches and transforms the relationship with consumers such that they consume more flavors of content across various media and enjoy more experiences in the presence of our brand in the real world.

Instead of trying to profit by stealing a little bit of attention/ engagement through playing ads, or selling ""hosting solutions"", RadioYo is using the RAO to reward 'wanted' behavior and 'desired' features.

Podcasters, online broadcasters, independent media and online publishers face a range of pressures every day. Funding, competition for listeners, press freedom, copyright infringement and producing the most remarkable programming possible weigh on people's minds every day. RadioYo is laying the groundwork for a new age of ownership, tracking, content sharing and creation that is engaging, sustainable, borderless, and fair to all stakeholders.

We're often asked how will RAO get its value? We think the RAO's value is derived in multiple ways: If you're a person who has watched RadioYo grow and wants to support it's continued growth by contributing to it, a la contributing to a KickStarter campaign, then you can do that. Alternatively, if you are interested in transparency and an open internet and want to benefit from the products and services available to you within the RadioYo ecosystem, then you can do that, too. (Ideally we hope people will participate in the ICO of the RAO for both reasons!)

Here are a few examples of how developers, consumers, podcasters, service providers and advertisers would use the RAO within RadioYo’s platform.

1. Monetization of Private Shows – Today, RadioYo Hosts can currently create private and public shows. Private shows allow ""influencer"" Hosts to create a walled off community. Hosts could use this feature as a call to action to engage their listeners.

2. User Generated Content – The RAO economy can incentivize content creation by rewarding creators. By allowing anyone to create content,
i.e., hosts, musicians, voice-over talent, artists, journalists, and authors, can be rewarded. RadioYo expects more consumers to participate and create content. This open market concept creates competition for higher-quality content and ultimately creates a better community.

3. Tipping – Consumers can tip content creators for content they like,
i.e., an episode, music, comment or article, and even service providers for something as simple as audio editing or post production. As an example, a consumer in a country where censorship flourishes can be rewarded for voting, sharing, commenting, publishing, etc.

4. Branding – RadioYo provides a new way for brands to directly engage consumers. Brands can reward users for completing simple tasks. This can include signing up for an advertiser's service, i.e., a Netflix account, answering survey questions, creating themed content, curating content or interacting with brand-sponsored audios/engagements.

RadioYo wants its legacy to be in the construction of a new blockchain-based broadcasting and services platform for podcasters, online broadcasters, independent media and online publishers. This platform will be open and sustainable while putting the global community first.

In this new world order, RadioYo is a participant rather than a landlord. With the aim of fostering a vibrant economy, the company pledges to promote products and services from the platform to its global community of users, while demonstrating its commitment to transparency and an open Internet.

The mission of Ash Elements is to turn an ugly liability into an attractive environmentally responsible asset.  This asset will be made available to the blockchain community and in doing so add value in many dimensions to our collective future.

Ash Elements Values

Protect the Environment
Secure Mineral Rights
Create Asset Value 
Build a Strategic REE stockpile for the US

Ash Elements Vision

Ash Elements is an Asset Back Token (ABT) that captures the value of rare earth minerals in coal ash in the form of mineral rights. Rare Earth Elements are referred to as vitamins for metals and electronics without which our high tech world ceases to exist. These mineral rights for premium coal ash basins are secured by a holding company through which mining or refining company can redeem ASH tokens Rare earth mineral rights to particular sites under contract. Each Ash Token is contractually tied to 1 metric ton of fly ash.

Rare Earth elements are a strategic imperative to the United States of America.  Many of these minerals have no substitutes. China has a virtual monopoly on Rare earth minerals and alternate supplies are needed to ensure that the world manufacturing base is not disrupted buy Rare earth mineral price fluctuations.  

The technology to extract these minerals from coal ash are being developed in research laboratories all over the world. Once these processes are matured and commercially viable coal ash will be in high demand. Those that have right to it likely will profit in this future world.  Ash Elements is a bridge to realize value of that future world today.

In the mean time while these technologies mature coal ash continues to be a controversial environmental problem and is considered a liability. The Ash Elements token addresses these issues by turning coal ash into an asset via the Etherium blockchain.  This makes money available for environmental clean up and preserves the asset for future use as a strategic minerals reserve.

(Project seems inactive or has been aborted)","What is Batan?
Batan is a digital carbon offset and a collective effort to address climate change. By using social media, the power of the crowd, and secure digital transaction technology, Batan turbo-charges existing efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The batan offset is composed of a basket of allowances and offsets from the world’s main emissions trading and carbon credit schemes. The basket composition reflects the size of each scheme and is designed to represent a global emissions reduction unit.

By purchasing and owning batans, you are supporting all of the major emissions reductions schemes around the world.

When you join Batan, you become part of a network of people who care about climate change and who are doing something about it. Individually there seems to be little we can do to have an impact on climate change, but collectively, we are powerful. As we each assume our responsibility and act, the drops in the ocean become waves which resonate around the globe.

What is the basket?
Batan is designed to be a standard global product representing the global emissions market. Individuals and companies can use a single product across all geographies. The basket uniquely includes both carbon offsets, which help fund new emissions reduction projects, and cancelled emissions allowances, which reduce emissions from existing sources. Some experts prefer offsets whereas others prefer allowances – our product includes both.

How much of an impact can we have?
We have dimensioned our technical platform to be able to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 100 billion tonnes. If we are able to achieve a fraction of this, we will collectively “move the dial” on global warming.",,Save a Tonne of Carbon!,London,United Kingdom,,,Europe,Western Europe,2015,,start-up,https://twitter.com/batan_ltd?edit=true,https://www.facebook.com/batancarbon/?ref=bookmarks,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Info@batan.io,,,,,x,,,,,,,,,,,,,

GIVE TO CHARITY + SAVE LIVES BY MINING + USING CLEAN WATER COIN
We’ve built a unique function into the coin network so that everyone who mines or even uses Clean Water Coin will be helping save lives around the world. Every transaction will donate 0.1% of that transaction to the Charity Wallet, here’s an example: I’ve mined 1,000 Clean Water Coins and I request a manual payout from my pool. As a result of this transaction 1 coin will be donated to the Charity Wallet and the remaining 999 is sent to my wallet.

THE CHARITY WALLET
All donations will go to the Charity Wallet and from there will go to CharityWater.org. To prevent flooding our own market with donated coins we will set a recurring schedule to exchange to BTC, this will help to prevent large sums building up over extended periods of time and exchanging all at once. We will also offer the community the ability to purchase Clean Water Coins from the Charity Wallet. Pricing will be established from a market average and the amount of coins available will depend on total donations to the Charity Wallet. More details regarding this feature are soon to come!

ADDING VALUE TO CLEAN WATER COIN
We recognize that there are many factors that go into the valuation of a coin. Some of those things we can attempt to control and affect, but others rely on the community, exchanges, and the industry. So rather than only relying on trading and exchanges to dictate pricing, we’ve gone to great lengths to add value to holding and using Clean Water Coin.

Giga Giving Vision
Every day millions of people make donations to charities across the globe. However, charities provide very little insight into where the donation is going, and how much of it gets applied. Unfortunately, charity fraud is an ever-growing concern with 1 in 3 people in the U.S. alone expressing distrust of how their donation is used.

Altruism, philanthropy and benevolence are all used to describe the fundamental desire in most people to have an impact and help others. Harnessing this basic inclination requires a strategy that weaves the individual, the employer, merchants, charitable organizations and fundraisers together in a new more efficient solution to address the rising tide of need in the world.

Giga Giving has an ambitious and holistic vision that uses blockchain technology to provide a platform that revolutionizes charitable giving.

Giga Giving is building a platform which will provide a new way to make donations, conduct charitable campaigns and fundraisers, all in a completely transparent and publicly accountable way; but more than that, it’s also a new way to connect people and their donations to those who need them with fewer transactions, less cost, and less complexity. Giga Giving is founded on the idea that charitable giving shouldn’t be opaque, or hard to understand. Our goal is to change how charities work around the world, by giving people complete insight into how their donation is used, and how it benefits others – while improving the efficiency of managing a charitable program through modern technology.

This platform will provide charitable organizations the necessary infrastructure to move into the future.

Why
With Blockchain technologies experiencing tremendous growth worldwide, there are many organizations that are trying to leverage this new concept in a way to help charities. The difference between Giga Giving and these other organizations, is that Giga Giving provides a start to finish platform to connect donors to recipients, with complete transparency, and accountability.

While Blockchain provides a public and tamper resistant ledger of donations, Giga Giving takes it a step further and helps donors search for recipients that meet their criteria and performance expectations. We help businesses meet their goals for social responsibility by empowering employees to contribute to charitable organizations through employee based programs. We allow direct peer to peer donations and provide a process for emergency disaster relief. Giga Giving facilitates donations that remain local with support for intangible assets such as goods and services.

We enhance the donor experience by allowing prospective donors to search for recipients and charities based on validated information, transparency, and history of impact. Giga Giving makes it possible for individuals and businesses to select specific charities to donate to, or set a criteria and preferences for their contributions which may allow the system to automate selecting or recommending recipients based on need.

Digital currency is a very elegant way to send money overseas or across traditional borders, making it a great way to donate while reducing transaction costs and fees. Many charitable organizations are working to leverage the Blockchain for cross- border donations. Giga Giving believes that redefining charitable giving requires a robust and forward thinking toolset to realize the full potential of a highly efficient, global, transparent, intelligent platform connecting donors to recipients.

Giga Giving believes that the solution to addressing inefficient charities and fraud is to build a completely transparent system that is purpose built to deliver donations where intended, with minimal transaction costs. With modern Blockchain technologies, that is finally possible on a global scale.

One of the key developments of modern Blockchains is the ability to define Smart Contracts. Smart Contracts serve to create an immutable and publicly verifiable electronic contract, which lays out very specific rules for how donations are handled. For example, you can design a Smart Contract that designates a donation recipient, what currency they need, how much they need, and a timeline for fulfilment. Then individuals can contribute into the contract, and once it meets the criteria for fulfilment, the funds are disbursed – directly to the intended recipient(s). 

And if it takes too long to reach the goal, or the recipient fails due-diligence, the donations can easily be returned to the contributors.
Smart Contracts are publicly viewable agreements, so anyone can review the contracts, and perform full diligence on them. They also make it easy to follow the progress of a donation to see who received it, and when. And yet another benefit of using Smart Contracts for a contribution is that they provide an electronic receipt for your donations, so if you need a record of your donations or just want to view your donation history, you can right from your smartphone or computer.

Giga Giving also provides a place where companies can agree to provide goods to fulfil a donation contract. This allows local companies the chance to invest in their own community and reduces waste related to transport and conversions.",,Charity on the Chain,Alpharetta,United States,,,North America,North America,2017,"John Goss, Managing Partner; Mark Phillips, Managing Partner; Jeremy McKee, Director of Engineering",,https://twitter.com/GigaGiving,https://www.facebook.com/gigagiving/,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=649A-ZL0GLY,http://gigagiving.com/GigaGiving-Whitepaper.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,info@gigagiving.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

We are a team of leading global experts and innovators in the areas of blockchain, cryptocurrency, fintech, microgrids, and utility systems. Our research, development , and commercialization activities are applied in the following three areas…

 Wattcoin Labs, a startup out of University of Wisconsin Madison and Illinois Institute of Technology, aims to be the payment platform that drives renewable energy consumption and transfer.
 
 Using blockchain technology, they’ve created a digital currency where people can transact energy without a central bank, similar to Bitcoin. Their goal is to improve access to energy for people who aren’t on the grid, create rewards for energy efficiency, and allow users to trade carbon and carbon value at a microscale.
 
 “In ways that Bitcoin changed financial transactions, Wattcoin will change energy transactions,” said Wattcoin founder Ben Johanns, a sophomore at UW-Madison and a Naperville native. “It is the beginning of the ‘Energy Internet.’” 
 
 IT IS THE BEGINNING OF THE ‘ENERGY INTERNET
 
 Their technology has a number of applications including setting up peer-to-peer energy transactions and renewable energy loyalty programs for utilities companies, but they’re starting out with payments for solar home systems in emerging markets, hoping to reduce dependency on kerosene and provide a payment solution for the unbanked.
 
 Wattcoin is currently developing the payment platform for Chicago energy company Veriown‘s forthcoming solar home system. Users purchase Wattcoin credits on a smart payment card from a local vendor (who completes the transaction on his or her smartphone), and place the card on a reader which converts the credits into energy that can power a light or smartphone charge.
 
 They’re aiming to address the question: “How can you transact for energy in the most rural places in the world?” said Johanns.
 
 He pointed out that kerosene (used by 1.3 billion people worldwide for light) causes both pollution and health problems. While renewable energy solution could provide a safer and cleaner energy option, the World Bank reports less than half of adults in South Asia and about a third of adults in sub-Saharan Africa have bank accounts, which makes paying for renewable energy difficult. Johanns believes Wattcoin can bridge that gap.
 
 Veriown demoed the solar home system with Wattcoin tech at the Energy Revolution Conference in Sierra Leone last spring, which led to 9,000 pre-orders (Veriown then paid for further commercialization and development of Wattcoin tech). They’re rolling out 45,000 units across three states in India (Uttar Pradesh, Gujurat, and Tamil Nadu) by late Q2 of this year, and are planning for a larger roll out by the end of the year.
 
 IN WAYS THAT BITCOIN CHANGED FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS, WATTCOIN WILL CHANGE ENERGY TRANSACTIONS
 
 Johanns previously worked as an intern at Veriown (his father, Steve Johanns, is the CEO) and has been Bitcoin mining since he was in middle school. Wattcoin team members also include recent Illinois Tech electrical engineering grad Jimmy Shah, current Illinois Tech electrical engineering graduate student Farsh Umrigar, UW-Madison electrical engineering sophomore Tyler Barker, and recent University of Pennsylvania grad Kristopher Jenk. Wattcoin will compete for $50,000 in the upcoming CleantechUP competition, held by the Clean Energy Trust and Department of Energy.
 
 As they move forward, Johanns sees Wattcoin as a platform-as-a-service company that makes money through licensing and transaction fees as they continue to roll out solutions. Next up, they’re working on a prototype of a carbon credit exchange on the blockchain.
 
 The energy industry needs a more “nimble” payment infrastructure, some have said, as independent wind and solar farms feed into the grid. Other startups besides Wattcoin are developing blockchain technology for the energy industry, such as New York-based LO3 Energy.
 
 “The reason blockchain is so transformative and why Wattcoin is using it is because the blockchain creates a great platform to move value across a global network without an intermediary or ‘middleman,'” explained Johanns. “In the case of energy you can create transactions for both [kilowatts] of energy as well as the carbon value of the energy. [This] allows for some disruptive business models where people can transact energy and carbon credits, or carbon offset credits, between themselves without going through middleman or utility.”",,Energy Enabled,Chicago,United States,,,North America,North America,2017,"Ben Johanns, Co-Founder; Steve Johanns, Co-Founder",start-up,https://twitter.com/wattcoin,https://www.facebook.com/Wattcoin,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LRHEoIVWSo,,,,https://www.americaninno.com/chicago/wattcoin-is-bringing-blockchain-technology-to-the-energy-industry/,,,,,,,,,,,,,info@wattcoin.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It can collect energy from the surrounding environment including solar, wind, waste energy and ground cooling. It can use that energy to produce 2,000 liters or more of drinking water per day. And, modules around the hub can be provided with access to that energy and water for vertical farming, greenhouse growth, rainwater processing, water purification, and algae farming.
 
 The WATERIG hubs and modules could be a valuable resource to the local community for providing a truly decentralized and sustainable water and food supply. 
 
 It’s flexible for easy scaling: each community can plug the different modules they need into the hub at their own pace.
 
 But the benefits of the system don’t just redound to the local community. Each WATERIG hub will contribute to two blockchains:
 
 The first blockchain will track the ownership of each hub, enabling community-level crowdfunding and micro-ownership without a central authority. 
 
 The second blockchain will collect data on water, food production, and usage transactions by its members. This has the potential to grow an economy around these WATERIG hubs.
 
 Both blockchains will be publically searchable with no interference or manipulation by companies or governments. This can increase efficiency, create jobs, and ultimately provide food and water to local communities.
 
 WATERIG is currently in the protytping stage as they are building a pilot in Hong Kong with a major vertical farming site and in Dongguan with a manufacturing plant. In 2018, they are looking to launch initial cryptotokens to allow creation of additional pilots around the world, and they plan to use this same system to scale globally as they grow and fundraise.

Charitex aims to deliver an innovation in such social enterprise, by deploying a smart business model and improving the technology of giving – with a vision to create real and positive impact for people.
Charitex is not a Charity or simply another crypto donation interface. Rather it is a profit-for-purpose business with a smart model and ambition to build and launch a blockchain for social impact platform.
As the digital space matures there is increasing demand for more authentic and ethical projects. And projects with asset backing.
Charitex is one response to this call.
It is a blockchain project – developed in Australia – to deliver positive social impact.
ICO’s may continue but Charitex presents the first-ever ECO™ (Ethical Coin Offering) with its ECO launch planned for late July 2018.

Distribution, trust, equity and peer-to-peer accountability is at the heart of blockchain.
This is a logical technology to deploy in order to address issues of social and environmental need.
A token economy can be designed to give attention to commercial imperatives, as well as, enable the building of positive social impact and value.
Charitex will leverage blockchain, integrate other tech and software plus engage a community to introduce a new approach to creating social impact.
The system side-steps the ongoing need for donations, instead will conduct a funding event offering positions in the Charitex Social Impact Fund with an associated Charitex token.
• Once established the business will put funds to work to create yield
• The business will evolve and generate ongoing revenue via multiple revenue streams
• It will link with and grow an engaged Community using the utility token (ERC20) for voting and social impact project nominations

Mayor Jesse Arreguín and City Councilmember Ben Bartlett are heading this project in conjunction with campus Blockchain Lab and with Neighborly, a technology firm that aims to reimagine municipal finance for the contemporary landscape. Berkeley plans to use blockchain, a digital technology that creates a ledger of economic transactions, to create bonds for funding affordable housing projects.

“Neighborly is building a crypto-enabled technology stack that will offer a new, customizable structure to finance critical community projects in the form of a new class of cryptoassets: cryptobonds,” said Kiran Jain, Neighborly’s chief operating officer, in an email.

BBI entails the creation of a municipal bond using blockchain technology. This involves an “initial community offering,” analogous to the initial coin offering used to crowdfund cryptocurrency, which allows Berkeley to take control of fundraising, according to Jain.

Community members can purchase digital tokens backed by municipal bonds. If the plan succeeds, Berkeley will be the first city to issue cryptocurrency.

“Issuers like Berkeley could use cryptobonds to finance affordable housing and the critical social services that Berkeley needs to address its growing homelessness population while meeting the needs of the socially-minded Berkeley investor,” Jain said in an email.

Berkeley has about 1,000 homeless people and increasingly high rents. Arreguín and Bartlett have both named homelessness as a key issue in their platforms.

“We’re not going to accept that there’s no money, we’re going to create it,” Bartlett said. “Blockchain technology is the future of public finance and human economic interactions.”

Cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, are based off blockchain technology. Bitcoin has garnered recent attention for its large fluctuations in value, rising from $1,000 to $19,000 and back down to $8,000 since January 2017. This has brought its reliability into question, which Bartlett refutes.

“Because it’s not a coin, it’s a bond, there will be no fluctuation in price,” Bartlett said. “The blockchain platform is secure.”

The project will be privately funded, with guidance from city officials. Neighborly is underwriting this project,  according to Bartlett.

“We feel that since this new economy is emerging, Berkeley should shape it,” Bartlett said. “We have the human ethic to make sure the human economy is just and results in shared prosperity.”",,,Berkeley,United States,,,North America,North America,2018,,Public-Private-Partnership,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Neighborly,United States,North America,North America,,,editor@dailycal.org,,James Dorn,jdorn@dailycal.org,Olivia Jerram,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These programs are broadening the scope of Alectra's use of the Sunverge Dynamic Virtual Power Plant (VPP) platform and are part of Alectra's ongoing strategic initiatives in decentralizing the grid through distributed energy resources and value creation through new services.

The goal of the NZEE program is to optimize the use of electric and gas resources to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions and move towards NZEE. The NZEE program consists of hybrid-heated homes in the community with Sunverge's DER platform controlling, managing and optimizing electric demand management (with solar PV + storage) and thermal load control to automatically and continuously optimize between electricity and natural gas for thermal energy needs based on the bulk power grid's GHG emissions. The Sunverge Dynamic VPP platform will receive real-time grid supply emissions data to determine optimal operation between gas and electricity, and coordinate across solar PV, energy storage, micro-combined heat and power (mCHP) with integrated air source heat pump, EV charger, thermostat and hot water heater controllers in order to minimize greenhouse gas emissions on an aggregated community wide VPP basis.

Alectra Utilities also selected Sunverge to be one of the first technology vendors to integrate with their upcoming Blockchain-enabled transactive energy platform. The platform, designed and implemented by Alectra, will facilitate contracting, compliance, and settlement of distribution level market services. The objective is to validate how blockchain technology can be leveraged to support the energy sector by tracking and assigning attributes and value to renewable energy generation that can be exchanged among parties with minimal cost. The Sunverge VPP platform will control residential solar PV, energy storage and EV chargers for localized demand response events, GHG reduction programs, and EV load shifting programs and interface with the Blockchain platform to provide the requisite ledger transactions for settlement. All aspects of market participation – availability, response time, duration – will be measured and instantly verified on the blockchain.

""Our goal is to leverage decentralization in many forms to responsibly create greater value and new services for our customers and community,"" said Vikram Singh, Director of Advanced Planning at Alectra Utilities. ""Our initial investments in DERs and VPP technology have proven it works and our choice of Sunverge has enabled us to continue our innovation.""

""Alectra is very creative and forward thinking in their approach to leveraging our platform,"" said Martin Milani, CEO of Sunverge. ""Our business relationship is leading the way to combining technology with new business strategies and services that will better serve the interests of the utility, the community, and the market as a whole.""

Farmers are unable to access affordable credit, insurance, high quality inputs, affordable logistics providers, and competitive markets. These inefficiencies lead to high rates of farmer poverty.  

Ricult aims to fix the agriculture value chain through a mobile platform. By improving the value chain, we are enabling farmers to pull themselves out of poverty while tapping a multi-billion dollar market. We launched our pilot in Pakistan in February 2016 and currently have over 3,600 farmers accessing our platform.

Ricult comes from the middle syllables of the word 'Agriculture'. In keeping with this phonetic tradition, Ricult aims to become integral to the agriculture of tomorrow. The solution to global problems like food shortage, malnourishment, poverty, rural unemployment need to start with smallholder farmers. We feel the world is ready for farming to be revolutionized and become more inclusive and empowering for the very people who form the backbone of this industry. This goal defines the very core of what we are all about. We are not a charity; We are an empowering community transformation. This is the basis for a brighter future, built on hand-ups, not handouts.

""We are social impact driven. Our goal is measured by the farmer’s income increase. We were able to increase their income by up to 50%. We want to keep doubling their income through technology to enable their families to afford health care, a better education and enrich their lives with a positive impact to the wider agriculture community.""",,,Philadelphia,United States,,,North America,North America,2016,"Aukrit Unahalekhaka, Co-Founder; Usman Javaid, Co-Founder & CEO",start-up,https://twitter.com/contact_ricult,https://www.facebook.com/contactricult/,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXWkW4QHaZg,,,,,,,Not known,,,,,"Thailand, Pakistan",Asia,,,,contact@ricult.com,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Winner of the Consensys hackathon 2017,"Mineral Track is an application that will reshape supply chains and incentivize responsible sourcing. winner consensys hackathon 2017. Mineral Track will reward compliant mines and intermediaries with higher paying work while offering end-users full due diligence through tracking supply chains and create financial agreements between actors on the blockchain.

By addressing the vulnerabilities of transparency and accountability within the industry, we hope to begin to solve the higher level issues of child labor, poor working conditions, and conflict support over time.

Responsible value chains can only exist when all actors are rewarded for their participation. Mining communities receive a better price for their products so that they can send their children to school while companies like Apple can fulfil the requirements of concerned consumers and regulators, and prove that they are responsible corporate citizens.

We will build a system with end-to-end supply chain traceability where downstream actors, especially end users will comply with their standards, expand sourcing from that particular supply chain, and can even support the mine financially, generating more business for everyone involved.

To address the first problem we’re looking to build a system in which actors in the supply chain only have to give up who they trade with instead of transactional data.

(Project seems inactive or has been aborted),"There are big challenges 1.5 Billion Muslims all around the world are facing as of today. Block chain technology will be the new future no doubt. Unfortunately Muslim society is following this revolution relatively slow and late. However HALAL Coin project aims to ease Muslims to keep up with the revolution. The main idea is to facilitate the mass adoption of HALAL Coin in long term. This will economically empower individuals since the maximum amount in circulation is fixed unlike fiat currencies. Easier trading and storage possibilities compared to gold. Aims to strengthen the commerce ties among Muslims internationally by offering a trustless commerce platform and another aim is to create a strong community and governance to become the leading force and leading voice of all Muslims which is the only way to stop expansion of ISIS propaganda.

Why HALAL Coin ??
First of all, as the name already implies, earnings for inverting in HALAL Coin is a ‘HALAL’ earning according to Islam since it is not ‘riba’ (interest) earning.?

Economic Reasons
Block chain technology is the safest way of storing and transferring assets. And it is getting understood that crypto economy is the future. It is way more superior in safety and growth aspects compared to precious metals and financial derivatives. However Muslim community has been relatively late and slow to adopt this technology.

Traditional investments methods like gold and fiat currencies are set to vanish gradually. Especially gold which is a very common investment among Muslims is set to lose its value very soon since cryptoassets are much more advantageous in many aspects.  Investing in Bitcoin or other cryptoassets would make rich only the early adopters of Bitcoin and other altcoins. It is the time to deploy an option for 1.5 Billion Muslims which comes from Muslims and for Muslims.

HALAL Coin is the first real opportunity for Muslims to improve the economic power of Muslims since it is developed by Muslims and supported by Muslims and non-Muslim fellows.
We are at the edge of a new and stronger economic crisis since no lessons are learnt from the last one. Instead Central Banks multiplied the amount of fiat currencies in the circulation which temporarily delayed a big correction and created an even bigger bubble which is due to explode very soon. This time it is called ‘Everything Bubble’ and this time stock market, real estate market and bonds market bubbles are set to explode all together. Cryptocurrencies and precious metals have been proven safe haven in these circumstances.

HALAL Coin  differs from other cryptocurrencies in a particular way. Let me explain how. All other cryptoassets are targeting cryptofuns all around the world predominantly which is already very saturated and there is not much room to grow. HALAL Coin however chooses a different path to grow, adoption of specific masses. Instead of aiming a global acceptance from the beginning which is very complicated and challenging for a new coin, HALAL Coin aims to have a local & society specific target mass which has stronger religious, cultural, economic and commercial connections already. Once this aim is achieved the global admittance will be inevitable eventually.

Ideological reasons
Although Islam is the religion of peace, charity and brotherhood, it is perceived quite negatively by western society especially after ISIS terrorism.  We real Muslims don’t consider them as Muslim since their actions are completely opposite to Islamic fundamentals, however those bunch of sinners are influencing the image of Islam more than the rest of 1,5 billion Muslims. ISIS has strong economic and human resources and recruiting especially young and fool Muslims in deep web and in local mosques. There should be something to be done by our huge Muslim anti ISIS community to stop ISIS poisoning our children.
The aim of HALAL Coin is to create a community and economic resources to establish and diffuse a strong anti ISIS propaganda on all web platforms and mosques and organizing events to inform Muslims about the ISIS religion scam.
Another common problem of Muslim nations is the anti-democratic puppet governments. Most Muslim nations condemned to live with it. I had personally foreseen that Arab spring was coming years before it started. Because internet and user friendly social media were being adopted by masses. A new Arab spring is on the road now because crypto revolution is coming. However this time it will be softer but more efficient. Because dictatorships will realize that they have to convince their citizens instead of oppressing. There will be no other way to survive for them. Cause if citizens lose their trust on government they will switch to crypto assets and this will weaken the government economically so that the fiat money they print will be useless to pay salaries of police and armed forces.

How?
As HALAL Coin project team and fastly growing HALAL Coin community will move together to decide where the resources should be allocated. This will be achieved by a regularly organized polls and feedbacks from HALAL Coin community.?

Marketing 
HALAL Coins are neither sold nor mined. HALAL Coins are earned as bounties , (more info https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2026521.0)  Some of the earned HALALs are sold at Waves DEX  by its holder.  Buying HALALs at Waves DEX Since it is not sold in an ICO or similar event only given as bounties makes HALAL Coin strong marketing  and fairly, merit base distributed This unique way of introduction of HALAL Coin  will bring  mass adoption of HALAL Coin by Muslims at first place. This includes intensive social media activity, advertisements and public events.  Admisson to several exchange platforms. (Bittrex, Tidex, Yobit, crptopia,livecoin etc.)  This aggressive marketing will be ongoing continuously. So the investors can see the effect of their contribution directly.??
At second stage, marketing will be expanded in order to reach masses which have never heard of even Bitcoin. At this stage the number of participating merchants and number of physical ATM s will be increased rapidly.
After certain acceptance is reached within certain countries, commerce chambers, financial and governmental institutions will be poked continuously in order to convince them to use HALAL Coin and/or encourage people to use it.

Technology development
After we successfully implement a separate Block-Chain (Intentionally POS ). At the moment we have been evaluating several existing technologies closely and performing tests (Waves , Ethereum, NEO, Next, Omni, Counterparty. etc ) We have successfully forked and tested so far several block chains. However new technologies are on the way like tangle, graphene and delegated POS among others. We want to make sure that the technology we fork and develop to be at least one of best for the time being and for the near future. Should be userfriendly, light, scalable, stabile and proven. We are very ambitious to deploy Token creation tool and a decentralized exchange platform on top of this block chain before the boom of Islamic capital adoption. 

Education & Anti ISIS propaganda
We will incentivize Muslim bloggers, youtubers, twitterers etc. for their contribution to widespread the idea behind the HALAL Coin and anti ISIS propaganda. There will be no free giveaway. We will work closely with our community to incentivize those individuals.
Furthermore, nonprofit educational organizations, sports organizations and public events like World Islamic Economic Forum will be sponsored and separate events will be held for both marketing and ideological reasons.",,,,,,,#N/A,#N/A,2017,,,https://twitter.com/HALAL_Coin,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In addition to causing premature deaths, NCDs also impede the quality of life of people. NCDs are a threat not only to human health, but also to economic development and growth. NCDs account for an annual loss of 5-10% of GDP in India, leading to a crippling effect on the individual and the economy.

Current health care systems, both in the public and private sectors, are heavily oriented towards reactive care and episodic treatment. There is less emphasis on preventive, primary and continuous care that is required to manage long term clinical and behavioral modifications necessary to manage chronic conditions and reduce long term health costs for individuals and health systems. NanoHealth has taken on this challenge of building a solution to tackle NCDs at scale.

Our trained health coaches, network of highly recognized doctors, and an integrated technology solution provide proactive and continuous care. We empower individuals, communities and governments to fight against the growing challenges of chronic diseases.",,,Hyderabad,India,,,Asia,Southern Asia,2014,"Manish Ranjan, CEO & Co-Founder",start-up,https://twitter.com/NanoHealth1,https://www.facebook.com/NanoHealth.in/,,,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ5_SJdc3d7yTueH8rVBAOw/feed,https://www.nhct.io/#download-link,,,,,NHCT,,,,,,,,,,,contact@nanohealth.in,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These goods are also assigned physical attributes such as colors and qualities. This makes it easy to monitor the condition of goods and ensure that any harm done is traced to a particular participant, and that goods whose quality has been compromised can be traced and recalled.

 So now we can go to the Zenome solution. We are going to create blockchain-based genomics ecosystem. Why blockchain?
 This technology is good if used correctly.
 It will allow:
 - secure storage of genetic data
 - exchange
 - getting profit from individuals
 - new genomic based services
 - transparency of the requests
 - rating system
 - payment system
 All that will allow you to create ecosystem of genomic information exchange.
 
 The Zenome solution is unique, because it allows different types of data to be stored using appropriate technologies. So genomic data is stored securely divided by small parts on the distributed network. Transaction data and rating system lives on the ethereum blockchain. All calculations can be done on nodes, managed by private blockchain. The scheme is flexible enough for all those activities .
