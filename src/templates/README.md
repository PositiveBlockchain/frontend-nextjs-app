# Templates Directory

The `templates` directory in this Next.js project contains template files that serve as starting points or predefined structures for specific components or pages. These templates can be used as a foundation for creating new components or pages with consistent structure and predefined code snippets.

## Directory Structure

The structure of the `templates` directory may vary based on the specific needs and organization of the project. Here is an example of a possible directory structure:

```
templates/
  |- component/
  |    |- ComponentTemplate.js
  |    |- ComponentTemplate.scss
  |
  |- page/
       |- PageTemplate.js
       |- PageTemplate.scss
```

In this example, the `templates` directory is divided into subdirectories based on the type of templates, such as `component` and `page`. This structure allows for easy navigation and management of different types of templates.

## Usage

To use a template, you can duplicate the template file(s) and rename them according to your requirements. Then, modify the duplicated files to build the desired component or page.

For example, if you want to create a new component based on the `ComponentTemplate.js` and `ComponentTemplate.scss`, you can duplicate these files, rename them to your desired component name, and make the necessary modifications to suit your needs.

```plaintext
templates/
  |- component/
  |    |- ComponentTemplate.js
  |    |- ComponentTemplate.scss
  |
  |- page/
       |- PageTemplate.js
       |- PageTemplate.scss
```

After duplicating and modifying the template files, you can move them to the appropriate location within your project's component or page directory.

Using templates can help you maintain consistency in your codebase, adhere to best practices, and save time by providing a starting point for creating new components or pages.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the existing templates or create new templates based on your project's requirements. You can modify the structure, add or remove code snippets, or include additional files to suit your specific needs.

Keeping templates organized within the `templates` directory ensures easy access and allows for efficient development by providing a library of reusable code snippets.

## Additional Resources
